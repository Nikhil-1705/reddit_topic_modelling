    "title": "Xiaomi 15 ultra vs vivo x200 ultra (india)",
    "text": "Hi.. can anyone guide me here. I'm out looking for a new phone. I currently have a s10+ and want the absolute best phone out there in particular best camera. I had zeroed myself on xiaomi 15 ultra and must have watched all videos related to it on YouTube! But the recent rumor of possible vivo x200 uktra launch in india, puts me in a dilemma - whether to wait for vivo x200 ultra in india or go ahead with xiaomi 15 ultra. I think I also read somewhere in gsm post that news that india launch may still not happen and it may remain China exclusive. \n\nI don't want to wait till April -May only to know launch may never take place (india) and if then if I buy xiaomi 15 ultra I would lose out on pre book offer as well.. Specs wise xiaomi 15 ultra is the only phone this year which has gonna both- 1 inch main sensor and a 200mp telephoto. That sounds very tempting atleast on paper. I'm not such a technical person to fully understand and appreciate vivo's move for going for 35 mm(main camera) and 1.28\" sensor. I'm not sure how that focal length would look, the details etc. Maybe it's good for human subjects but what about other scenarios..  So even if vivo x200 ultra gonna launch in india I'm not sure whether that's the best implementation since they are dropping 1 inch sensor.. Xiaomi on other hand downgraded their main camera (by dropping variable aperture) as well as the ultrwide camera.. infact their photos this year don't look so contrasty which was their usp.. I prefer 15 ultra to vivo x200 pro so not so confused regarding that.",

I was looking into Xiaomi options because I kept seeing they were decent for their price but I'm not married to the notion or anything. if theres something like Honor or Samsung thats similar or better I can also do that.\n\nWhat do you think about these options around my price range:\n\n* Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 4g 256gb 8gb RAM\n* Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G Dual SIM 256 GB 8 GB RAM\n* Xiaomi Pocophone Poco M6 Pro Dual SIM 512 GB 12 GB RAM\n* Xiaomi Redmi Note 11S 5G 128 GB\n\nI keep hearing horror stories about how 4g in 2025 is awful, So I thought Id ask about that too, If i'm not doing anything fancy will my xp change in any way?\n\nI'm in Mexico.",

    "text": "I recently got a Zenfone 10 after struggling to find a phone that's not oversized and has the features I want for 8+ years.\n\nHowever, almost all the glass screen protectors I can find don't extend all the way to the edges of the screen (the only in stock one I can locate which I have been told is edge to edge is a pfivacy/polarized protector, which I'd rather not use... but hey, maybe you all can find some I can't?), which makes me concerned about how effective they'll be if the phone is dropped.\n\nAs I understand it, the entire point of a glass screen protector over a film based one is that the glass protector absorbs the energy of an impact, and the protector breaks instead of the actual phone screen.\n\nBut, if the protector doesn't extend to the edges of the screen anyways, and the phone is dropped and lands on the edges or a corner, then won't the energy of the impact travel through and break the actual phone screen before it enters the protector? Will the non-edge-to-edge glass protector actually be any more protective then a film based screen protector?\n\nAnd yes, I get it would be effective if the screen lands flat face down, but I'd have a TPU case which would prevent that likely anyways, and if the case did come loose in the impact, it would presumably still be an edge or a corner that makes contact first",

Now I want a new one and I was looking for samsung again because it seemed convenient if all the tech I buy came from the same brand.\n\nI want something mid range, but not *that* mid range. I'll be fine as long as the camera is decent, and the storage is around 128 or something. But I've also heard that one needs to look up the software updates and such.\n\nI came across the Galaxy A55, and I (with whatever understand I could) think it's a good enough phone.\n\nThe main uses I'll need from a phone is a decent camera because I plan to open a small business later (clay trinkets and needlework and such) and I feel the camera is good enough.

    "title": "The S25 ultra is unbeatable for a workphone",
    "text": "Hi,\n\nI keep on reading questions and comparisons between the S25U and other flagships such as the OnePlus 13, Xiaomi 15 ultra, etc. Most of the questions and answers are around hardware such as screen, battery and cameras. \n\nThese are valid questions and answers, but i wanted to bring another software oriented perspective to the mix, if one is planning to use its phone mainly for office work. Under such a scenario the S25U is worth more than the sum of its hardware parts. \n\n1. One u.i\n\nI used to hate One u.i back in the days, to the point it was the main reason keeping me away from Samsung. Those days where Samsung was known for its useless bloatware are gone. Yes there still is quite a few. But most can now be uninstalled, and some like samsung internet really bring a plus to the table with its a.i integration. \nThen there is the total and absolute personalisation, from the font style to the folder size and everything imaginable, without needing a launcher. You even get more personalisation options with one u.i than with Nova launcher, particularly if confident enough to dive into its developer mode. For work this ability to fully arrange your homescreens and have everything under your eyes completely tailored to your mind structure is great. \n\n2. A.i\n\nWhen talking about the a.i present on the S25U, people often relate to it as \"gimmicky\". I can only guess these refer to media oriented a.i, like picture modification or a.i based drawings. But there are things that are REALLY useful in a work environment. A couple of non exhaustive examples:\n- voice recorder has a great voice recognition and transcription of recorded audios. Super useful for personal use but also to have transcripts of your meetings. It can even translate them after. \n- the same goes for all document related a.i: resuming documents, rewording your written documents in a better way, text and number recognition on pdfs, pictures etc... Those are handful features in a work environment and they function well\n\n3. S pen\n\nI used to own a galaxy note and hardly used its s pen, because it was a hassle to go through my handwritten notes, particularly as the small screen and tiny pen make for a crappy hand writing. A.i is a game changer for the use of the s pen. Now all my hand written notes are transcribed in regular text, i can then use a search engine to go through them using keywords, integrate them in many apps, etc... I am now using the pen to take quick notes during meetings. And the Samsung note app is amazingly easy and friendly to use. \n\nOverall i feel like the S25U is under rated as an office work phone, it brings great and useful features that no other phone whatever the hardware can bring. One can feel the extensive experience Samsung has earned in designing its U.I in the most practical and user friendly manner over the years. Everything just makes sense. \n\nSo sure it has the most boring designs of all phones. Yes it's sad they didn't upgrade more like at least a carbon silicon battery this year. Yes the camera is great at stills but far from great for moving objects and people. Yes, for personal use there are definitely as good and better options out there. But for office work? Sorry but not sorry, nothing comes close to the S25U. \n\nAs a final love statement, i adore the design of the Galaxy watch 7. It beats my old apple watch 10 times aesthetic wise. The round case fits watch faces much better. The proposed watch faces are gorgeous. The attention to details down to the small blue and red accents on the strap is candy to the eye, and it's super comfortable to wear. Was gonna attach a picture of it side by side on wrist with the dull Apple watch in comparison but can't, not sure why.",

The battery life is declining so when I need to change I am trying to figure out to what.\n\n\nI use my phone to google things, check the weather, text people, make calls, check mail and Facebook and my banking apps. I listen to a TON of spotify music. I also take a ton of photos, most are just of random stuff though. I am not needing super professional photos. With my ADHD I tend to have way too many photos, and way too many browser tabs open at all times.\n\nI don’t care what brand at this point. I just want whatever will do these things at the best price point for the longest time. Bonus points if it’s smaller in size.",

    "text": "I've been using an iPhone 7 for about seven years and have been really happy with it. It never let me down! I mostly used it for email, YouTube, web browsing, Google Maps, offline GPS, and taking photos during hikes. Unfortunately, the screen got smashed, and now I can no longer use it.\n\nFor the past week, I've been using a Samsung Galaxy S24 as a temporary replacement. So far, I haven't encountered any issues, and I might stick with it long-term. I like how it functions more like a computer, especially with its file management system. As a Windows user who isn't part of the Apple ecosystem, that's a big plus.\n\nHowever, the experience feels a bit overwhelming at times. The phone seems packed with prompts, buttons, options, and tips, almost like I'm in an airplane cockpit. It’s a bit much, and I'm not sure how some of these features impact other functions. On the other hand, the iPhone was much simpler.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is the duplication of Google and Samsung apps. I’m not sure which ones I should keep or delete. The iPhone software also felt more polished and worked nearly instantly right out of the box. One small but annoying difference is that when Gemini or Google Assistant activates, there's no feedback noise to let me know it’s listening, unlike Siri, which does make a sound. That’s been helpful when I’m trying to locate my phone.\n\nThese are the main differences I've noticed between the iPhone and Galaxy so far. I’m not sure if they’re deal-breakers yet, but I’m trying to figure out what to expect from the Samsung S24 in the long run and its overall reliability, and of course, any final recommendations.",

Great speed, great battery eficiency, no overheating.\n\nthe fact that samsung did it bad before with exynos, doesnt mean it was always gonna be like that\n\nDont let Exynos reputation prevent you from getting S24 fe\n\n2) Value-money\n\nPeople say that there are several better options for the price (or little bit more).. Totally true.. when i got the phone from samsung renewd 550$ for 256 gb version, 3 days after, i went into swappa and i saw a S24+ 256gb 12 ram for 600$... Thats My only regret about S24 fe. \n\nAnd i think.. thats S24 fe biggest weak point is rivals in that range of price  (other weaknesses, like weight or not enough brightness on screen) \n\nNevertheless, after 15 days using the phone, i can say im super happy with my phone, its great. \n\nSo if you have a chance on a good deal for this phone, totally go for it.",

It’s lagging (especially when taking pictures which is super important for me) and overall just kinda not the best. Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nThe only reason an iPhones on the list is because I already have one and I like the location sharing and the connectivity of it all. I’ve had them for awhile now but I’m aware of how overrated apple is. \n\nI used to own 2 androids but they never seemed to last long which I hated more than anything whereas iPhones for me seem to last much longer. That was years ago and I was a kid so I can’t be certain it would be the same now.\n\nPer month I would pay around;\niPhone 16: $20\nSamsung galaxy s25+: $20\nGoogle pixel 9 pro: $15\n\nThank you!",

My top priority are great pictures of moving objects (aka my toddler), my Xiaomi takes shitty pictures now and it's too slow and I really want to create nice photos to look back at. \n\n2. Something that will last longer than 3 years and still be usable - ideally I would buy a new phone after around 4 years (if needed). I wouldn't want to see a huge drop in performance after 2 years or so, I don't game on my phone (I'm a PC gal), so I don't need anything super amazing but I want consistency - I don't want to wait 5 seconds for some app to open and then still have some lagging. \n\nI am okay with charging my phone every night but at the beginning I'd be happy for longer battery life, of course. I don't need a lot of space, I have 128gb now, I have issues with it but I want to use cloud more with my new device. But 256gb would be nice. 120 Hz would also be nice.\n\nIdeally, I want to spend up to around 600$ but I could spend more if it is really worth it.\n\nCurrently, I am thinking about Samsung S56, Pixel 8 pro, Samsung 24 Fe, OnePlus 14R. I would like to buy it now or around April, May latest.\n\nI am also thinking about iphone 16, which is not an android (of course), is very expensive for me and I don't use any other Apple products, however... I feel like they always have the best photos and long life. And that new camera control with shutter speed setting makes me think it could be the best but at the same time it doesn't really make sense for me to buy.",

    "text": "I have been an iPhone 7 user for nearly a decade. But due to phone breaking, I am looking for a replacement. I am considering an iPhone or a Galaxy S24. I am not a heavy user, i mostly use phone for communication, email, maps and youtube. I have no other apple products nor am i interested in them.\n\nI like the ability to connect an android phone to a computer to transfer files, whereas on iPhone, I need to download apps and do a whole rigmarole just to do that. However, I do not do this often so it is not a deal breaker. I am sure there are other open-endedness that can be done with an android that i would find convenient. I do not care much about customization though, I would rather the phone do it for me without having me to spend time or think about it.\n\nBased on my experience with iPhone 7, it is a solid phone, has worked all these years, very reliable and smooth. I would still hang on to it if it did not get broken. I do not care much about updates as I do not notice any change in functionality with them. Do Samsung phones have this type of long-term reliability? I would say that reliability and dependability are most important.\n\nOverall, should i stick either iPhone or try android on the Samsung phone?",

If You cannot turn the alarm off manually for some reason, just wait long enough. It should stop eventually at some point.\n\nIf any of You could help me with finding a new phone, that's costs about 200-300 € or $, I would be very glad!\n\nI'm looking for a phone with the following features: \n\n* dual-sim\n* 5G\n* decent camera (ideally it has a stabilizer and takes \"warm\" photos)\n* ideally 3,5 mm headphone jack\n* ideally also wireless charging, but I know that's not to be expected in that price range (somehow my USB-C ports in phones tend to break fast, no matter how carefull I am.)\n\nI'm mostly using my phone for calls, texting, social media, music and would like to take decent photos with it. I guess I would like the phone to be a little more decent than normal everyday phones. Also my phone won't be used for gaming!\n\nThank You in advance! ♡",

    "text": "My priority is that a phone should take good pictures, especially in low light and good photos of moving pets and children.\nAlso I like natural colors. I'm so done with my contrasty Samsung. It's so contrasty that I hate it - it makes dark circles under eyes even darker, beauty blemishes worse and for example my 3-month old baby has a tiny blue blood vessel shown on his face and this stupid samsung makes it 10 times darker and worse.  That contrasty look is only good when taking photos of flowers... not humans..My samsung is a mid-range device, it doesn’t have any lagging issues or smth like that, but what it also has is a shitty gps, which I also hate, so I wish my next phone has reliable gps. Gps is the only thing that lags with that samsung. Also I hate samsung's keyboard. I misspell a lot with this keyboard. My previous phone was Huawei P20 pro, loved it and it lasted 4 years, perfect keyboard, reliable gps and I loved the Leica camera. I know Xiaomi 15 also has a Leica camera, which might be great. But how good is that when taking photos of moving subjects or pets? Is it better or worse than iphone's photos? And when watching youtube reviews Xiaomi 15 doesn’t appear to have very natural colors. Like I said, I'm so done with contrasty colors. Maybe Xiaomi's colors arent as bad as Samsung, but not sure. Does anyone has experience with the new Xiaomi?\nI really like Iphone 16 natural colors though. And I like that 16 pro has a better zoom than 16 plus. I don’t need better zoom all of the time, but sometimes it's nice to have it when shooting a video for example a running squirrel or when being at a concert. Also I'm very into photography, so pro version is something I'd like. And that desert titanium color that 16 pro has is so eye-pleasing. 16 plus colors aren't that great.\nBut I've read  that16 pro has a really bad battery life. Is it true? Can it get better, when changing some settings? Is there a chance it will get better with updates? Or is this a lost cause?\nI know 16 plus has a better battery, which I really like, because I use my phone  a lot - for taking pictures, videos and also I use social media (tiktok,youtube, instagram, messenger) and gps, when driving. And right now I feel like I'm a heavy user, because I'm on maternity leave for the next year and I use my phone a lot more, when staying home.\nAnd about the screen rate - it doesn’t  matter if it's 60 or 120 hz.",

    "text": "Hello and thank you!\n\nI’ve got an **iPhone XR,** which is about to hit 4 years old since I bought it refurbished right at the end of the UK Covid lockdown Part II. The battery’s getting a bit weak (80%) and the new OS upgrade is a bit hit or miss, but other than that, it’s still going strong.\n\n**LORE BELOW, SKIP TO BULLETS FOR TLDR**\n\nBefore this, I had a **OnePlus 3,** which I picked up on launch day, I think it was around the end of Obama’s second term, just after Brexit had been revealed. Before that, I had a **Lumia 925** that I got for my 28th birthday in 2013 – my first proper smartphone, replacing the **Nokia N95,** which was kind of the ultimate feature phone or maybe even the hagfish of smartphones. I got that N95 around Obama’s first inauguration when I was working at Phones4You, a couple of years after college, during my \"sabbatical\" in the UK, which is now turning 18 years this year.\n\nThat N95 replaced my old trusty **Nokia 3200,** which was my college phone and I received during that Iraq Invasion  Protest summer,  replacing  my first ever mobile, a **Nokia 3310**. That 3310 was given to me by my dad when I was 15, after I finished Secondary School with good grades. It was the summer of 2000, just as Luis Figo was signing for Real Madrid, and before my dad sent me off on a 12-hour train journey to spend the summer with my grandparents at the village.  \nSo with that nobodyasked lore out of the way but hopefully providing an insight into my relationship with phones, I´m turning 40 this year and my wife is asking if I need a new phone, done a bit of research and found out that:\n\n* I really like the design and price of the Nothing Phone 3a and feel in hand of the pixel 8a.\n* The new iPhone 16E can also be an interesting pick, given that I work now for an iphone accesories manufacturer, and I have access to free cases and accessories, and I´m already in the \"ecosystem\", as my computer is an iMac. (Although I can´t say It´s such a big deal for me)\n* Maybe I don´t need to upgrade, the phone still does eveyrthing I bought it for as intended, and it´s up to date with the latest software. Maybe just visit the polish guys around the corner, they´re my go to repairs shop, for a battery swap??\n\nCurrent usecases of my phone: Whatsapp, Podcasts, Music, Mobile Banking, Calculator, Maps, Mail, ewallet,   torch, QR scanner, vinted, freeletics, classpass, calendar, couple other apps, I play on chess dot com sometimes when on the train or the bus.\n\nDont use it for: Gaming, non utility photo (have a cheeky nice Ricoh camera for that and a DSLR for work), watch videos, reading a lot of text\n\nmy screentime is around  2-3 hrs a day.\n\n\n\n**Is there any meaninful advancements to 2025 phones that will blow my mind vs what I got?** or is it just minor quality bof life and iterative upgrades that since I don´t know I need them, I don´t need to care?  \nThank you love you all!!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1j9iz6j)",

It’s definitely time for an upgrade, but I’m torn between getting the iPhone 16/16e or waiting for the iPhone 17.\n\nThere are rumors that the iPhone 17 lineup will finally have 120Hz across all models, which is tempting. But I don’t know if I can (or should) wait another year with my nearly dead 8 Plus.\n\nFor those who have been in a similar situation, what would you do? Is it worth waiting, or should I just go for the 16 or 16. Would love to hear your thoughts.",

I’ve liked iOS, but would prefer to go back to Android.\n\nApple have dropped the mini line, looking at alternatives and there seems to be a big fat pile of nothing everything is humongous, whether it flagship or entry level. Only phones that seem to be of any interest is the Samsung Z flip or Moto Razr, but I’m really worried about the longevity of a modern flip given I do tend to abuse my phones a bit and like to keep them for 4-5 years.\n\nCan anyone recommend me something to look at, even from a more obscure brand? Or vouch for the long term reliability of these flips?",

    "text": "Pretty much just having trouble deciding if I should keep my current iPhone or swap back to Samsung because of how poor the battery on my 15 pro performs. I use 5G data almost 6-8 hours a day because I am outside a lot without access to wifi. I'm wondering if the battery will be better on the S25 with 5G on? I'm also curious as to what features I'll be gaining/losing if I swap to Samsung. Moreover, I'm not really one who cares for customizations and stuff even when I used Samsung phones a few years back so this isn't really something I would consider a gain for myself from moving to android. What I really like about my current setup with the iPhone is integration with their apple watch and iPad and just how basic it works because I mainly just use my phone for texting and watching content. Would it be worth losing features I like about apple products over a similar sized phone with a bigger battery?\n\nAdditionally, I use apple pay a lot. How does Samsung/Google's wallet fair against apple pay?\n\nEdit: Another thing I forgot to mention is I like having the option to clear the cache system wide with my old Samsung phone from a few years ago. Unlike apple's automated system which just pisses me off because of how much storage they take up.",

    "text": "Long post. \nApple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. \n\nRecently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. \nApple is so smart with adding words like ‘innovation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘best ever’, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. \n\nA simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?\nWhat is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? \nNFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. \n\nThe customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don’t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. \n\nNo separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. \nThe action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. \n\nThe cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. \nAgain, stubborn with their features telling us — this is what we will give, deal with it.\nCome on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. \n\nBasic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. \nNo fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should’ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their “security and privacy rule”! \n\nNo doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. \nThey got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. \n\nThe notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)\n\nSiri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn’t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn’t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. \n\nRefresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. \nNow, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. \nI have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. \n\nCharging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it “saving the environment”? Peak capitalism! \nThey were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung’s chargers? Yet another sly move here. \n\nWhat is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? \nWe are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! \nThe new ‘move to iOS’ app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! \nThis should have been an easy task but no. \nApple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? \nWhy should we rely on third party apps? \nAndroid phones have this so easy. \n\nFile management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! \nJust a simple copy paste should do! \n5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!\nThey got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. \nCannot connect to many smart TVs! \n\nWe don’t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. \nPeople are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. \nThe brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. \nAnd Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. \n\nMany other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. \nBefore you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don’t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. \nJust wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones.",

These are advertised as “cosmetically flawless”.\n\nSo picked up a 16 Pro Max 256 GB at $1,460 CAD ($250 off), and received it yesterday.\n\nBest Buy was spot on with the description - device looks like new with zero visible wear anywhere.  It shows as being activated in January, and has 0 battery cycles.\n\nSo for anyone curious about if these devices meet Best Buy’s description, they certainly do.  Great way to save some shekels if you don’t want to be tied to a contract.",

    "text": "So I'm looking for a new phone.  I haven't really gotten a good answer as to the importance of RAM vs a processor.  Is it really only important for multitasking? Having multiple/alot of apps open at the same time and just flipping back and forth? Or for gaming?  I keep hearing more RAM is always better, but do I really need 12 or even 8 gb of RAM?  I'm not gaming (yet) and I mostly listen to podcasts and scroll news feeds/browse the web.  I like Samsung phones and especially their One UI, and have had a great run with them.  But I look at Poco/Xiaomi phones and see the \"better\" specs and lower price and think why not?  Example: X7 Pro (379/400) vs. A55/56(365/479) or Note 14 4g 8gb (170) vs. A25/35(200/270).  German Euro Prices.  I'm torn between just buying a Samsung and getting less ram but IMO a quality phone with longevity or getting a cheaper/more bang for my buck Xiaomi with all the \"greatest\" specs.  I'm also unfamiliar with MIUI/HyperOS and really like my One UI but am willing to try something different.  I don't think I'd like the Pixel UI as it's a bit bare bones. (?) Any thoughts?\n\nSo is RAM really important or is it better to have a good quality SoC/OS?",

    "text": "I am completely torn between these two options: OnePlus 13 (16GB; 512GB) and Pixel 9 Pro XL (16GB; 128GB). I'm a OnePlus user and a huge fan but the Pixel works to about $500 cheaper as far as the 2-year ownership costs are concerned. This is because my current provider does not have any promos for any of these devices but I can get a $500 promo if i switch to Mint. Now, OP 13 definitely has the better hardware (CPU, GPU and battery/charger especially), but is it worth the extra $500 cost over 2 years? I'm a pretty heavy user (spend about 8-10 hours everyday on my phone) and require a super snappy experience while also being able to run multiple applications/browser tabs at a time, multi task, etc. I do not take many pics, don't game, etc but I greatly value audio quality when listening through headphones. So, if you were in my situation, which would you choose and why?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the comments guys. I will be going with the OP. The 128 Gig storage and Tensor G4 seem like deal breakers to me.",

Sure its 4 vs 7 years of software updates, but at this point I wouldnt care.\n\nAre there any caveats to Xiaomi? Im aware of the software bloat, but any other significant downsides?\n\nThe major reason I went with Samsung over other brands is the brand awareness (dad has owned Samsung and trusts the brand vs the \"no name\" Xiaomi) and the longer software updates and probably the nicer OneUI.

Therefore, I'm somewhat unfamiliar with what smartphones can and can't do when it comes to GPS.\n\nMy question: can a smartphone's GPS be switched on to communicate with *another* smartphone (via a call or whatever), with the latter then tracking it from a distance? One of my climactic final scenes involves a character needing to track someone down who is 10km away in a rural area and in mortal danger if they aren't located. They have no way of pinpointing them otherwise. Could they do so if their smartphones were 'linked up', or am I going to have to use a bit of creative licence?",

But after discovering and watching videos on the new Nothing phone 3a, I’ve started to take a liking to this new phone and thinking maybe this will be the next move. Both of these phones will be a big jump of an upgrade no matter what but it got me thinking: what if there’s something that the nothing phone can’t do but the iPhone 16 can and vice versa? I’m a guy who’s not that big into photos, videos, and selfies but I go to music events and travel to national parks and states and want to capture good quality pic or video, and if I see something funny, cool or nice I’ll capture it. I want a phone that runs very smooth and expect no or constant lags/delays. I mainly use my phone for music, YouTube, social media, texting and calls. I’ve rarely used android phones so I don’t have a good idea of how it runs. Price wise the nothing phone is pretty adorable unlike the iPhone 16 but I’ll save up for it if I decide.

It's been 2 years and now i want a new phone. I was promised a new phone for my birthday cause even my mother finds my one unusable.

Yet she was willing to buy me a 16e with cost 100 dollars more and is absolute hot garbarge. There is not much difference between the 15 and base 16 so i dont see any reason why not to get it. Sure it will get 1 year less of updates and no apple intelligence but that doesnt really matter.

    "text": "I have been using IOS for more than 10 years and now still using Xs max for 6 years.I’m in opt between continuing using IOS or switching to Android upper midrange.I liked Iphones mainly because of smoothness which last like forever.This is like the only reason now.I don’t care about most features like magsafe,wireless charging,dynamic islands,etc.Now details on why I’m thinking switching to Android.I care about price to performance.You can get an android phone at half price with almost same specs I care about(OLED display,120Hz,Metal frame,AI features) while iphone non-pro only has 60Hz.For further preferences,cameras should be decent for photo,good speakers is a MUST.When it comes to smoothness,I heard Android upper midrange 120Hz can easily compete with IOS in 2025.I wanna know if it’s true.What would you recommend for Android?If you recommend iphone,feel free to tell me the reasons why you recommend over android.\n\nEdit-I’m not gaming.My main purposes are social media,youtube streaming,music.I still want near best experiences for those.",

    "title": "Which compact flagship to choose?",
    "text": "I'm using a Galaxy A40 rn and I'm generally happy with it, but the charging stops working randomly, so I'm looking for a new phone.\n\nI need a super reliable, compact phone with good battery life and a decent camera. After analyzing the market, I've narrowed it down to four options. Below is a breakdown of the pros and cons based on my needs.\n\n\n1. Samsung Galaxy S25\n\nPros:\n- Best small form factor, super lightweight\n- Familiar UI, so I'll feel at home from the get-go\n- Well-balanced device with no major flaws\n\nCons:\n- after using Galaxy for 4 years, it's getting boring, and I’d like to try something new\n\n2. Google Pixel 9 Pro\n\nPros:\n- very appealing clean OS \n- Packed with AI features I plan to use for work\n- stellar camera experience\n-  by far the cheapest option where I live\n\nCons:\n- Uncomfortably heavy (like the iPhone 16 Pro)\n- Pixel’s notorious for poor heat management\n- Larger than the other options\n- Mixed battery life reviews\n\n3. Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nPros:\n+ Best resale value over time (at least where I live)\n+ well optimized battery life\n+ camera that just works.\n+ probably the best heat managenent from the pack\n+ Always admired Apple and wanted to try one\n\nCons:\n- as a lifelong Android user, I'm worried iOS would disrupt my productivity, making buying a new phone pointless since it's meant to be a work tool \n- quite heavy (like the Pixel)\n- Not interested in diving into Apple’s ecosystem, except for this phone (I’m a Linux user btw)\n\n4. Xiaomi 15\n\nPros:\n+ Best battery life by far\n+ decent camera\n+ Compact and lightweight, smaller than the iPhone and Pixel\n+ Brand aligns with my values outside the prestige ones\n\nCons:\n- the OS is known to be bloated as hell, which is the last thing I want for my productivity\n- Likely poor long-term durability compared to others\n- chinese phones depreciate so fast that reselling doesn't make sense, forcing me to keep it until it dies\n\nOverall priorities:\n\n1. Battery life - Essential as I'm often on the go\n2. Reliability - I store important data and can't risk losing it if the phone breaks\n3. Compactness and weight - I just dislike big phones\n4. Good heat management - My Galaxies overheat during navigation or video calls, and I won’t buy another phone with this issue\n\nThings I don’t care about:\n\n1. Fast/wireless charging\n2. Speaker quality\n3. Fingerprint sensor (I don’t use it)\n4. Years of updates (I won’t keep the phone more than 4 years)\n\nI decided not to focus on camera and CPU specs, as all the listed phones perform well in these areas. The Pixel and Galaxy have an AI advantage, but it’s subjective.\n\nThe S25 seemed like the best choice since it has everything. Then I considered the Pixel, praised for addressing overheating and battery issues. But if I’m buying a 200g phone, I might as well get the iPhone, which has the same virtues without Pixel’s flaws. Then there's Xiaomi, with great battery life and size, but the bloatware is nearly a dealbreaker.\n\nPlease don't suggest the Vivo X200 Pro Mini (I'm not buying it from China) or OnePlus 13 (it's too big). Both are great, but not options for me.\n\nLastly, there are many reviews online, but they focus mainly on performance and battery out of the box. For me, the more important factor is how the phones perform after 2-3 years of use.",

It seems like at this rate its gonna take forever until conquer that last pixel.\n\nIve read that the screen tech requires at least some space to fit in and that the edge pixels might introduce fringing and so on, but a possible solution could be to just tuck that away under the frame body and start the actual viewing area right from the frame border. In this age the bezels are the number one visual sign of a phone either feeling modern or outdated.",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm trying to decide between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra and could use some advice.\n\n# Why I'm leaning toward the iPhone:\n\n* I've used Apple phones my whole life, and my family is all on Apple, so staying in the ecosystem would be easier.\n* I already have AirPods, so everything would stay seamless.\n* AppleCare+ seems like a big plus, especially since I have an Apple Store nearby for quick support.\n* I use AirDrop and FaceTime a lot, and I'd miss them if I switched.\n\n# Why I'm considering the Galaxy S25 Ultra:\n\n* The 8K video and zoom are really tempting. I go to motorsport events often, and since the cars are far away, I want to capture high-quality zoomed-in shots for Instagram and personal memories.\n* That said, motorsport photography is only about 10-15% of what I’d capture—the rest would be normal life photos/videos.\n* I've heard mixed things about Samsung Care+ compared to AppleCare+ and don’t want to be stuck without good support if something happens to the phone.\n\n# My main questions:\n\n* Does anyone use the iPhone for capturing moving objects at a distance? How is the quality for motorsport photography or anything fast-moving?\n* Is the Galaxy S25 Ultra worth it for the zoom, or does the iPhone 16 Pro Max perform well enough at a distance?\n* If you've used Samsung Care+, how does it compare to AppleCare+?\n\nWould love to hear from people who’ve used both for photography and videography! Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "Hello everyone. I need to buy a new phone, and I'm having a hard time deciding between the S24+ and the regular iPhone 15. They both cost roughly the same in my local store. My main priority is the camera.\nI've had a samsung S20+ for 5 years now and I've been very happy with it, that's why I'm considering just switching to a newer samsung model. On the other hand, I've never had an iPhone before and would like to try it once, but the problem is that they are much more expensive, and if I wanted to buy the Pro version, it would be out of my budget - i can afford only the regular iphone 15/16.\n\nHas anyone ever tested both, or has experience with samsung and iphone cameras?\n\nThanks in advance :)",

    "text": "I’ve been using iPhones since the 4S but have always been intrigued by the Pixel lineup. Over the years, I’ve tried multiple Pixels (2 XL, 3 XL, 6P, 7P, 8P) but never stuck with them. Issues like reception problems, display size (too big), or the Apple ecosystem pull kept bringing me back. Now that the Pixel 9 Pro has a smaller variant, I’m considering switching again.\n\nThe problem? I’m heavily invested in Apple—MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, AirPods Pro/Max, Apple Watch for sleep/fitness tracking, and Apple One. Plus, all but five of my friends and all of my family use Apple devices. That said, I’m frustrated with iOS 18’s bugs, underwhelmed by Apple Intelligence, and not loving my iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nHas anyone in a similar situation successfully switched to Android? If so, what helped you stick with it? Or should I just accept that Apple is where I belong and learn to live with its quirks? Also, would the S25 Ultra be a smarter move for trade-in value if I decide to go Pixel 10 Pro in a few months?\n\nLooking for real experiences and advice!",

However, Apple Ecosystem is nice, especially to be able to use the quick access to apple notes with the Apple pencil and then sync it to the Phone. Otherwise I would be fine to rely on Google Apps like calendar etc on iOS. Main argument for Pixel 8a is the much much better Price. From the Phones capability I would be fine with iPhone 16e, but price is mad. Older I phones like 13 are out cause of lightning...also important for me are long update guarantee and good future proof battery!\nmaybe someone can help me or has some thoughts:) thanks in advance",

I even picked my old S21 FE from the drawer just to use android again for a while. After that I realized that with the money I paid for this phone I could buy an S24 Ultra and a Watch 7 and this is driving me crazy. \n\nEither I like it or not the iphone is a work tool so I can’t replace it. I trapped in iOS and I better forget anything else. That’s my pain",

I know its not a hardware issue because I've had returned the previous one over doing the same thing.\n\nEverything feels a bit slow to use even with animations reduced, something simple like turning on my hotspot for my partner to use my connection took like 10 seconds while on my p7p its instant, it just turns on. I'm not sure what's happening on the iphone but ive tried restarting using the volume and power and resetting the phone entirely.. I have it for around a week. There is some other bugs here and there and the navigation feels kind of painful to use but overall I'm loving iOS for how simple it is to use and how apps are designed better like facebook having all the menu at the bottom.\n\nI kinda feel bad having paid 1400 for a phone that's crashing, a selfie camera that's hit or miss depending on the lighting.. the lighting has to be perfect for the selfie camera to have anything decent.. yes I take selfies I moved countries and i facecall my family to make sure they see I'm fine.\n\np.s After all the negative things I will say again, I do love iOS I love that i can install extensions into safari rather than downloading 3rd party browsers like on android to do it. I love the settings being very simple to use and easy to navigate. The main camera is very nice even though its not as high in MP as other competitors I find that it takes the most appealing pictures to me. Only thing is notifications but that's whatever.",

    "text": "I have always been an iphone user and am in need of a new phone. I do not like the size of most new phones (too large) and am also considering moving away from iphone. \n\nThe only iphone atm I think which would suit me would be the SE, which hasnt been updated in a few years and it still probably overpriced due to being an iphone. \n\nSo I was wondering if anyone could recommend a different phone. I am looking for something not very large (ie something that fits in your palm and fingers), not covers your entire hand and with the best possible performance and battery life, without being really expensive. \n\nIf there is one thing I care about the least, that is the camera, while im sure it unlikely to find one, Id take a phone without a camera for all I care.",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m currently using a 6.1-inch phone and have always been on the smaller side of things, but I’m seriously considering upgrading to a larger phone (around 6.7 inches or more).\n\nMy main reasons for considering the switch are:\n\t•\tBetter battery life: I’ve heard that larger phones generally have a bigger battery, which would be great for my day-to-day use.\n\t•\tBetter content viewing: Watching videos, reading, and browsing would probably be more enjoyable on a larger screen.\n\nI’m not really into gaming, so performance in that department isn’t something I’m concerned about. But I do want to hear from people who have made the switch—was the extra battery life and screen real estate worth it? How much of a hassle is it to carry around a phone that size, especially if you’re used to a more compact one? Any other insights would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA little about me: I’m a guy who works in IT, so I’m pretty tech-savvy, but I’d love to hear your real-world experiences.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Heck, I could turn it into a dashcam for the car or the bike if I can have it use GPS without a phone plan (hooray for upcycling!).\n\n**Here's what I'm looking for:**\n\n\\- My budget is up to $1000, including accessories.  One of them can be 3D printer filament since I own a Bambu Labs P1S.\n\n\\- 1 TB of storage data.\n\n\\- Unlocked AT&T that can use a nano-sized SIM card.\n\n\\- I need an amazing camera that can capture wildlife images without getting too close, especially birds with their quick movements.  Hopefully, I can capture pics of bugs and other tiny critters without needing to turn on pro mode.\n\n\\- It has a good microphone for audio capture when recording videos or just sounds in general so I won't need another accessory.  If that isn't possible, one can be included in the budget.\n\n\\- I need it to run smoothly when I play games and not have its battery drain too quickly.  Pokemon GO is one I would love to play a bit more smoothly.\n\n\\- 5+ G data, but can use older data towers.\n\n\\- The phone does not need to be the latest model.  If the price is right compared to the hardware and lack of bloatware I am getting, that would be great.  I am interested in hearing about any upcoming sales from reliable online retailers that may help here.\n\n\\- The only AI I want from the box is Google's.  Not Samsung's or anybody else's.\n\n\\- I do not want pressure sensitivity since I do not like drawing on my phone.  Screens are typically too small.\n\n\\- I want the phone to be as future-proof as possible.\n\n\\- It must have the ability to cast to any HDMI device like a TV or projector without downloading any other app via cable.\n\n\\- Something that may not be possible, but I would like for it to block calls from anywhere in the world except for places I give an exemption to.  I don't want to treat all incoming calls from those not in my contacts list as suspicious.  Also, not needing any other app for this.",

    "text": "Pixel 9 pro range and iPhone 16 pros (and regulars?) have this and it's obnoxious imo. There's literally no reason for it aside from aesthetics. The phones are heavier and larger than their predecessors which wouldn't be a problem if the shape of the phone didn't literally make them harder to hold. The only reason a phone as huge as the s25u is so easy to hold relative to phones nearing its screen size is the (relatively) light weight, great balance and ability to grip the phone. The more bulbous and slowly rounded the corners, the less able you are to maneuver the phone confidently.\n\nRecall the stupid Thanos meme--perfectly balanced, as everything should be. The iPhone 15 pro and to a slightly lesser extent, the 15 pro max, are like this as well. They feel more blade like with the ability to be held at more severe angles rather than having to situate the entire phone's mass in the palm of your hand. \n\nUnfortunately, Samsung is the only one not falling into this dopey trend (so far). Hopefully these companies start making better designed devices. Apple had ONE YEAR where they stopped making cumbersome phones and immediately switched back to doing it. Whhhhhy?!?",

    "title": "iPhone 15 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S25",
    "text": "I have placed myself in a bit of a situation, and I am losing my mind deciding on these.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am totally platform-agnostic. I am not sucked into any one ecosystem and, while I have a MacBook, I am not one of those that consider AirDrop this *integral feature that I cannot live without* like you find over at r/Apple.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n# iPhone\n\nBasically, I have an iPhone 15 Pro. I purchased this when it came out in 2023 — after a few years using an Xperia — because I was so darn happy that Apple finally swapped to USB-C. *About damn time*. Better still, I even purchased 2-years of the full AppleCare coverage (incl. theft), that still has until Feb 2026 before it expires.\n\nThis means, even though the device is battered and bruised, I really don't care about that and I can just use the phone while it still works — and works it still does! Even has the new Apple Intelligence features and all.\n\nAnd if I break it still in the meantime? Well, an £80 excess fee and a day later I'll just have a new one. Fab.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n# Samsung\n\nThe problem I have with Apple at the moment is the political climate.\n\nI am British — Apple is in the process of revoking E2EE cloud storage here in the UK. Not the end of the world, as I have that MacBook to back up locally like in the olden days. But I am also surprisingly charged by the current American administration.\n\nAppreciate the UK has been left out of the firing line (so far) but I am so appalled by the attacks on Europe, Canada, and now Ukraine that I kind of just want to purge all American devices from my property. Great excuse (albeit farfetched) for an early upgrade, too.\n\nSo, I went ahead and bought an S25. Same storage level as my iPhone, size, and even -£100 off. I reckon if I sold the iPhone (with the AppleCare) I could even make a small profit as it's still highly sought after — the cost burden of juggling both these phones isn't the issue here.\n\nMy last Samsung was an S22, and I really liked it (except the battery). We usually get Exynos here, but the S25 is SD — so I thought this is a killer phone to have right now, that should last.\n\nAnd yet ...I'm hesitating opening the box in its return period...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n# My problem\n\nI'm stalling opening the Samsung mainly because of an upcoming trip to Japan — that just so happens to be on the last day of the return period. This device isn't insured, and so I am a little terrified of taking it abroad — breaking it — and then about -£699 out of pocket without that same insurance catchment I have if I broke the iPhone abroad at the moment.\n\nThe other thing is that (as I suspect you might agree here) perhaps this was just a bit of a pointless purchase?\n\nLike, the iPhone's purchase was accounted for and customer by Apple in 2023. It's a spent product, and I am barely giving Apple any more money today by simply using it. I think maybe I'm just being petty about the Trump administration, especially as it's something so massively out of my control.\n\nI guess my question is, am I right to be hesitant about jumping on (what is) such a minimal upgrade, even if the hardware's Korean? Or is the S25 (with SD) actually millions times better than the iPhone I currently have?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts here.",

    "text": "I'm looking to change phones after using my Huawei P40 for 5 years, and I could use some help narrowing down my choices.\n\nWhile I've enjoyed Huawei's innovations and hardware performance, I don't want to deal with another 5 years of declining services as more apps require Google services to function properly. So I'm ready to switch to another Android brand.\n\nOne feature I really love on my P40 is the infrared front camera for unlocking in the dark, while also having fingerprint authentication. From my research, not many brands offer this option, and those that do tend to put it on enormous phones. I prefer a smaller, more comfortable form factor.\n\nMy previous experience with a Samsung A40 was disappointing due to severe lag issues, so I'm not interested in trying the Samsung A series again.\n\nI'd also like to avoid Xiaomi phones - both my parents use them, and I find their Android skin to be the worst I've ever seen. Same goes for Google Pixel phones, as I strongly dislike Google.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

I don't need an upgrade, unless you think there are things WORTH upgrading for, please let me know.\n\nAt $400 that phone was perfect. I want something just like it. That's fine. Works well.

I was thinking about waiting till they announce the Iphone 17 and if there is finally a drastic change in their Phones. Especially considering the Battery and Chinese Brands offering a new battery technology ( cant recall the name).\n\nI feel like none of the \"big\" brands offer a real improvement over the phones of the last 3-4 years.

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been using a Samsung Galaxy S9+ with 64GB since its release (so almost 7 years now), and as you can imagine, it’s barely holding on. Performance is terrible, the battery drains insanely fast, and storage is becoming an issue. It’s about time for an upgrade.\n\nI prefer Samsung but am open to other Android brands if they offer better value. One of my friends recommended the Samsung Galaxy A54, but I’m wondering if that’s really the best choice in my price range.\n\nMy main requirements:\n\n• Good battery life (current phone dies in no time)\n\n• At least 128GB storage (more is a plus)\n\n• Budget: ideally under €500, but I can go up to €800 max\n\nOptional:\n\n• A good camera would be a plus, but not my top priority\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone's recommendations.",

    "text": "Hello, I'm a student living in germany and looking to buy a decent and reliable (preferably) iphone to build an ecosystem. I also own a macbook air m1 (2020) and an ipad 9th gen (2021) which have offered a great value without having to be upgraded after every few years.\n\nGiven that, I currently use an android, specifically the OnePlus Nord Ce 2 lite (2022), which has been a great performer for its sub 200€ price. Naturally wanting to upgrade, I feel it'd be great to do so while also having an entry into the apple ecosystem. \n\nMy current budget is around 600€ and have gone through several options like a used 15 pro, used 16 (upwards of ~675€), new/used 15 (650/600€). I had been waiting for the SE4/16e but the pricing vs. value just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nThe key areas in which I'm looking an upgrade are: \n1) good cameras (not having to use gcam),\n2) a decent battery for non-intensive daily use (5-6h of SoT),\n3) atleast a few OS upgrades (haven't had the best experiences with androids like oneplus, asus, motorola etc.),\n4) a compact size and decent in-hand feel which won't be a fingerprint magnet (~6.1/6.2\")\n5) a smooth user experience (snapdragon 695 is definitely showing its age),\n6) usb-c (so the 14 pro doesn't really make sense).\n7) *Edit: good haptics (I've tried the pixel 9 and the haptics were great, don't know how it compares to apple though)\n\nI'm aware that features like an always-on display, higher charging speeds, 120hz, dedicated telephoto lens are going to be the trade-offs but are they a deal breaker for someone upgrading from a series of cheap/budget android phones? Even though I feel the galaxy S24 (~640€ for 256gb) is cheaper and overall superior in terms of how much functionality a phone (along with its os) can offer, but is it enough to offset the convenience that an ecosystem can bring?\n\n\nPS: I've never used/owned an iphone before.",

I could replace the battery (there are 3rd party 5450 mAh  batteries online) but I would rather get something with a bigger battery from the get go, rather than spend money replacing the battery in the iPhone and find that it's still not enough.\n\nI've seen 10800 mAh (indestructible) phones on Amazon but I feel like the screen quality isn't going to be very good. I would be happy to go as low as 8000 mAh (or lower if it will last the 8 hours screen on time). I'm happy to pick something up second hand if it means I get a better screen. Again, I will only use the phone as a camera monitor. I do not need a camera, 5g and will have it in airplane mode most of the time. Budget is sub 200EUR.",

Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood - a perfect game for porting, great for touch controls with its fighting/drawing mechanics.\n2. Gothic 1 & 2 - It's possible to play it already via Winlator but this game deserves its own port. Would be very handy on a touchscreen.\n3. Simcity 4 - also an extremely good idea for a port. RCT Classic proved those kind of games can be very well made with extremely good controls.\n4. Sims 2 - could be very comfortable on a touchscreen and is old enough to work on most devices nowadays.\n5. Fable: The Lost Chapters - a game that is just begging to be ported to Android.\n6. Worms Armageddon / Worms World Party - arguably two best in the whole series. Perfect for touch controls and cooping by just passing the phone.\n7. Sacred 1 - this might be a tricky one but Diablo 1 through DevilutionX proved that those kind of games can be fun and comfortable enough even on a touchscreen.\n8. Ori and the Blind Forest - there is a very well done port of Hollow Knight on Android, Ori is a more demanding game in terms of processing power but I believe its an easy enough port for most devices to run it already.\n9. Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven - GTA ports are quite good, why not port the first Mafia game? :D\n10. Need For Speed: Underground 1 & 2 / NFS Most Wanted (2005) - seriously those would be the best mobile racing games.",

You'll see your standard DND mode along with Bedtime, Driving Mode, etc.\n\nIt also allows you to set up custom modes. I thought this would be cool, as you can cater them to specific apps. So I made one called \"Messages\" and only selected my messaging apps to be shown.\n\nBut then I saw that doing that _also_ changes the apps allowed in your other DND modes! This essentially makes it useless because it means every \"mode\" has the same apps that will notify you. \n\nWith my main DND mode I want apps like Home and Nanit to pull through, but with my Messages mode I only want my messaging apps - but it doesn't work that way. What's the point of allowing you to set up custom modes if they all work the same?\n\nI only hope this was just implemented as a step to something new in Android 16, because otherwise I don't see the usefulness of this new menu at all.",

    "text": "Today I was thinking about how similar iOS and Android are today, but at the same time, it's crazy that small details make all the difference.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve with iOS is the lack of a Back button.\n\nI often look at people in public transport, to see how they manage to go back with iPhones.\n\nNo matter if they are young or old, male or female, the Back gesture works 80% of the time for them.\n\nIt's just that they're used to it, so if it fails, they immediately do it again.\n\nI don't think that's a nice user experience for such a common action.\n\nIf only it was as simple as doing the gesture! No.. no.. Sometimes the gesture doesnt work just because the developer of the app didn't implement it. Then you learn you can only tap the arrow button on the top left, \n\nSometimes you realize you can only continue with the flow of the app (eg tapping Next).\n\nSometimes you realize the gesture doesnt work because there's a Done/Cancel text button at the top right corner.\n\nNow, even if they fixed that mess and added a navigation bar like on Android, there are still pet peeves that would keep me from moving:\n\n1. You can't plug an iPhone to a PC and expect to see files and folders. You need to use iTunes.\n2. You can't safely charge an iPhone with a wireless charger that isn't an original Apple one ($40), as the phone can get crazy hot; even without a case. \n3. The notifications are hard to dismiss. You need to do a weird swipe down to expose that view, and then a broad gesture to dismiss it towards the bottom.\n4. No double tap to turn off the screen and lock.\n5. Face id forces you to pick up the phone. So, no unlocking when it's flat on a table, unless you awkwardly reach out to show your face.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m working on a challenging project: getting an Android device to trick an iPhone into recognizing it as an AirDrop-compatible device. The goal is seamless file transfer without relying on third-party apps on the iPhone. I’ve broken down AirDrop’s process and started experimenting, but I’m hitting walls—hoping for some advice from the hive mind!\n\n# What I Know So Far\n\nAirDrop uses two key phases:\n\n1. **BLE Advertisement (Discovery)**\n   * iPhones broadcast BLE packets with Apple-specific data: a custom UUID, partial device hash (Apple ID/cert-based), and AWDL channel info.\n   * iPhones filter out non-Apple devices by checking for signed identifiers and the right UUID.\n2. **mDNS & AWDL (Connection/Auth)**\n   * After BLE, it switches to mDNS (Bonjour) for service discovery and AWDL (Apple’s Wi-Fi Direct) for transfer.\n   * Authentication involves Apple-signed certificates and an encrypted challenge-response—super locked down.\n\n# My Plan\n\n* **Step 1**: Sniff AirDrop BLE packets with Wireshark + an nRF52840 dongle, then mimic them on a rooted Android using custom advertisements (Python + BlueZ).\n* **Step 2**: Spoof mDNS with Avahi on Android to announce an \\_airdrop.\\_tcp service.\n* **Step 3**: Fake AWDL and authentication (the hard part—trying to analyze handshakes, but encryption’s a beast).\n\n# Progress & Tools\n\n* Captured BLE packets from an iPhone—see Apple’s UUID and some hashed data, but not sure how to replicate the signature.\n* Android (rooted, LineageOS) can broadcast custom BLE ads, but the iPhone ignores them (wrong format?).\n* mDNS kinda works, but AWDL is a black box—sniffed Wi-Fi traffic, but it’s all encrypted gibberish.\n* Using: Wireshark, nRF Connect, BlueZ, Termux, and a Linux laptop with a monitor-mode Wi-Fi card.\n\n# Where I’m Stuck\n\n1. **BLE Spoofing**: How do I craft a BLE packet that passes Apple’s “is this an Apple device” check? Is the signature in the manufacturer data crackable?\n2. **AWDL/Auth**: Any way to reverse-engineer AWDL or fake the certificate handshake? OpenDrop and NearDrop got partial success with Macs, but iPhones seem stricter.\n3. **Realism Check**: Am I crazy to think this is doable without Apple’s private keys?\n\n# Questions for You\n\n* Has anyone messed with AirDrop’s BLE or AWDL before? Any packet captures or tools to share?\n* Tips for spoofing Apple’s signed identifiers—possible without jailbreaking the iPhone?\n* Should I ditch AWDL and fake just enough to trigger discovery, then pivot to a custom transfer method?\n\nI know this is a long shot—Apple’s ecosystem is a fortress—but I’m stubborn and curious. Any pointers, code snippets, or “you’re insane, try this instead” advice would be awesome. Thanks in advance!",

    "text": "I bought the Galaxy S24 FE in December, and honestly, I’m sick of how Samsung is treating its FE lineup. I always thought FE stood for \"Fan Edition\", meaning it should cater to tech enthusiasts who appreciate premium features and performance. And yes, the S24 FE performs really well, with great features, but why is Samsung ignoring it when it comes to software updates?\n\nI was genuinely excited to try out One UI 7, but Samsung keeps delaying it! It’s been way too long, and at this point, I don't even think they’ll release the stable version for the FE series anytime soon. Worse, Samsung refuses to add the FE lineup to the Beta Program. Why?!\n\nI'm the kind of person who loves testing new devices and software. I actively engage in tech communities, and I'm even part of the Windows Canary Program, where I test early builds of Windows. But it’s beyond frustrating that Samsung doesn't let FE users participate in Beta testing, especially when there are so many of us eager to provide feedback and help improve One UI.\n\nAnd it’s not just me—surely there are other FE users who want to join the Beta Program too! Even the A-series is going to be the part of Beta program, and on the other hand FE-series which is expensive and powerful won't. If Samsung refuses to listen the fans, then what’s the point of the FE lineup?\n\nSamsung, if you're listening, please add FE devices to the Beta Program and release One UI 7 for us ASAP. This is getting ridiculous!",

    "text": "Alright, hear me out on this one... the ROG Phone 9 is arguably one of the top high-performance smartphones out right now. The biggest drawback: probably the lack of an even minimally-acceptable camera system.\n\nSo what happens when you take the ROG Phone's top-of-the-line performance, long battery life, one of the only 3.5mm jacks in a flagship smartphone, and a dedicated gaming mode — and you give it a camera setup that's actually usable?\n\nThe Asus Zenfone 12 Ultra: one of the most-hated (or maybe most-ignored) flagships out right now.\n\nI get it. Asus customer service sucks, it's as expensive as a Samsung, the camera still lags behind other flagships, you expect 7 years of feature updates for a phone that sells a tiny fraction of what other brands do, you still want a mini phone even though they haven't been selling, you could buy a phone from a Chinese company for $500... and so on.\n\nBut for the right person (definitely not everyone), I think it's still worth a look. If you're willing to accept that at this point, Android OS \"updates\" are basically unsubstantive except for a couple new gimmicky AI features tacked on top each year, then you'll be glad to hear that this phone offers:\n\n- 5 years of software support (but only 2 official version updates)\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- 5500 mah battery w/ 65W wired charging \n- 3.5mm headphone jack in 2025\n- 50MP main camera + 32MP telephoto + 13MP ultra wide\n- A suite of AI features that can be run on-device instead of in the cloud\n- Up to 144hz refresh rate\n- One of the cleanest, \"stock\" feeling Android skins (with just enough random features to make it feel unique)\n- Incredible battery usage control (did I mention that 3.5mm jack? You can keep your Bluetooth off, and even charge while you plug in your headphones)\n\nAs a current Zenfone 10 owner I've honestly loved my phone. Do other phones have better cameras? Sure, but they can't make it through two days on a single charge. The whole one-handed phone experience has been incredibly convenient, but I can't say I'd be mad if I had to watch videos on a reasonably larger screen. I think part of me is a little frustrated that for how damn fast this phone is, it would be stupid to game on such a tiny screen.\n\nNo longer sold in the US, but I might try and ship one in once I'm ready to upgrade.",

    "title": "Xiaomi 15 Optical Modular System EXPLAINED - How is this different from previous attempts by other brands like Sony?",
    "text": "Ever since Xiaomi showcased their prototype Xiaomi 15 Pro with an attachable fixed lens Micro4/3 sensor module, people have drawn comparisons with Sony's DSC QX series of \"Lens Style Cameras\" and also with past efforts from Samsung like Galaxy NX lineup.\n\nLet me explain how Xiaomi's solution is significantly more advanced than what Sony did with the QX series. Like the name suggests the QX series from Sony was a series of actual standalone cameras simply without a viewfinder and grip. It has the sensor, E-mount, batteries, processor and microSD storage, it's a full camera on it's own. It could be mounted to any phone using a clamp and would simply stream the preview to the phone's screen using Sony's app. That's it. The phone acted as the viewfinder and control for the exposure settings. You click the shutter, which makes the QX camera take the photo like any Sony mirrorless camera and transfer the image using WiFi Direct to the phone. The QX30/10/100/1 are basically standalone cameras.\n\nWhat makes the Xiaomi special is the fact that the phone's ISP directly interacts with the actual MFT sensor on the module through a 10Gbps connection, giving it access to some of the most advanced modern image processing techniques! Think about multi-exposure stacked HDR, possible night mode, enhanced portrait mode etc. It's not possible to take clean looking/detailed night shots using a real camera unless you are hulking around a big f1.4 lens, it's not possible to take portrait mode shots with really shallow DOF and good compression unless you are carrying a large 85mm f1.8 lens - with computational photography + large MFT sensor will theoretically enable some of the best fake portrait mode shots/HDR/night mode images! That's exactly how Xiaomi is able to eke out 16 stops of DR from the MFT sensor module.\n\n[These two are not even remotely the same. They just look similar. ](https://preview.redd.it/5adyxdelxime1.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7f0c5e40759d60e1004dc907b44001107d2436)\n\nThis is truly the first time we are seeing an MFT sensor + modern image signal processing!\n\nCompared to the Samsung Galaxy NX, it's closer. Galaxy NX1 was a full on APSC mirrorless camera with the guts of a Galaxy S4 (I think), but in the early 2010s, computational photography was practically non-existent, or ISPs weren't fast enough to process APSC sensor data or they simply didn't want to apply any processing as such. Mirrorless cameras were still in it's infancy and Canon/Nikon DSLRs ruled the market. Samsung left the market while Sony stuck to it and both were later on successful in their own fields.\n\nOne small gripe regarding the Xiaomi: They could've exposed the MFT mount, so that we could attach any MFT lens from different brands like Leica, Panasonic, Olympus, Sigma etc. May be they did that to save space.\n\nThanks for reading!",

    "text": "After reporting Asus to the EU consumer protection (in October) for asking me $200 to unlock the bootloader of my phone they were forced to offer a refund for the phone, since an advertised free feature was not only taken away, but now being something I would have to pay $200 to get back after an RMA.\n\nAll the documents/communication with Asus proving what I say, will be uploaded for reference.\n\nAsus said I have to return the phone to get the refund, which is fair enough. Fedex delivered my phone to Asus Holland, 1 month ago (see proof of delivery on January 28). Since then, I haven't gotten ANYTHING from Asus. No refund, no confirmation that they even received my device, no update in the process, not even an estimate.\n\nAt point 3 in their own document (ASGL end user compensation instruction letter rev 1 6\\_clean\\_final) they clearly state the refund should be given within 30 days of the day the documents were issued. The \"Place and issuing date\" on the documents is January 10 (marked with yellow), which means they are already 18 days late. At point 4 it says \"If you have not received the confirmation and payment within the time mentioned in point 3, please contact your local ASUS Hotline or contact Asus via \"email\" \" both are non-existent...\n\nMy contact for this whole process has been \"Christos\\_P\" from Asus support in Greece. The day of the delivery I asked him for an for an estimation about the refund, which he said is \"15 days after the case is closed\" I thought that \"case is closed\" meant them receiving the phone, but no. After the 15 days passed, I asked for an update and was informed that my case is not even closed yet and there is no estimation for when that will happen. Which means 30 days after, I am still more than 15 business days away for even getting my refund approved. Since then (Feb 19) I asked twice for an update, which he said we are waiting from \"the appropriate department\" and the contact information of the person who has my device right now, which he didn't even acknowledge.\n\nI don't think that my case should take more than 1-2 days to be resolved. They got the phone back, check/test it, give the refund, its that simple. After 30 days with no useful communication, it really feels like they have stolen my phone. I thought to report them in the cyber crime police here, but since my phone is in the Netherlands I doubt they can do anything. I will file a new report to the EU consumer protection, but that will probably take many months (again). Any help/suggestions on how to deal with this will be appreciated.",

Just multiply an old ratings number by the conversion factor (ideally convert it to minutes first...) and you'll get a ballpark of what it would have gotten with the new rating.",

    "text": "I'm sure the topic of iPhone users switching to Android comes up a lot but I just wanted to reflect with others on something I realized as I was thinking about buying a new phone.\n\nI didn't *really* need a new phone, but I was just curious to see what was out there. My iPhone battery wasn't doing too great and I wanted to get a new phone with a nice camera ahead of an upcoming trip. I've had an Android before and was just curious how Android phones were in 2025 so I expanded my search to include Android phones.\n\nThe thing I instantly appreciated the most in looking at Android buying experience was the simple ability to have a choice to begin with. When buying a new iPhone, if you still want an iPhone you don't really have a choice at what you get. I mean sure you can buy a regular, a pro or a pro max and configure the storage but...that's not the most exciting? This is in no way a critique of the iPhone, they've perfected a device and it sells because people like it. The buying experience just isn't that exciting though.\n\nWhen I expanded my scope to Android phones the choices expanded drastically. It felt like back in the late 2000s / early 2010s where the phone market was full of companies actually trying to design a new phone. It was exciting looking at Pixels, Samsung, OnePlus, all of these different phones and actually seeing some differences. I know today's phone market doesn't really compare to how it was say 10-15 years ago, but for the first time I was actually excited about the purchasing experience. Ended up going with the S25 Ultra and couldn't be happier. This time I'm also going to try to not get stuck into one brand's eco system. Make's switching so much more difficult.\n\n**TLDR**: Shopping for an Android was so much more fun because I actually had the option to choose something.",

I've submitted an RMA which Google even made a [specific page for](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15009955?hl=en).\n\nSo apparently, this is a world wide phenomenon that happens to a lot of users, no matter which brand or model. Something must be wrong here. Clearly the screen is prone to this, yet no manufacturer seems to care enough to get it fixed completely? They all mutually agree to just repair/replace the units that people RMA. Google offers a free RMA, Samsung seems to be charging about 50 dollars last I saw online.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to pop in and share this. It's weird.",

    "text": "Say what you want about Epic - I'm not a huge fan. I like getting free games, but will always prefer steam. However, on the mobile app store front - steam hasn't gotten involved, and -currently we only really have android or apple app stores. Neither of those are good. Apple is greedy and awful, the Gplay store is full of absolute crap - and don't even get me started on what trash somehow is still featured as \"editor's recommendations\"... Really, Epic having some success here would likely be a win for consumers...\n\n\n\nHOWEVER, I can't recommend using the Epic App Store, (except for collecting the free games) for now. This is because it is missing one very key element: informational transparency. The default app stores at least have a ratings and reviews section. Sure, it's usually full of useless junk - but I am positive that I've saved dozens of hours (and possibly some money) by seeing reviews that warned of possible issues (be it technical issue on a specific device, a general crash or bug, or a misleading storefront page).\n\n\n\nWithout providing users a way to easily share information such as this, Epic is inherently providing a worse service than its competitors. Seeing as how the competition has the advantage of being native to the phones, coming pre-installed, and already being used by literally everyone on a phone - Epic can't afford to also be a worse user-experience. \n\n  \nThis might not be an issue, if everything worked.  Of course - it doesn't. I have already personally experienced massive problems with 2 (of only like 20ish total) games on the platform. \n\n  \nI would like them to get the message, because I actually do think it would be potentially good for the consumers for there to be legitimately viable competition in this market. However, the EGS mobile app is simply not there. I've contacted them about this, but they likely won't hear one person. If you agree, maybe contact them, as well. \n\n  \nThanks for your time",

    "text": "I couldn't find an up-to-date guide that compiled all the information together or contained my personal discoveries, so I decided to make one. I’ll be providing some help with managing thermals for better performance with daily tasks and gaming\n\n**Backstory**: I have the Samsung Galaxy S22+ with the Snapdragon 8th Gen 1 processor, which is notorious for its hot SoC. The main issue I encountered was that while the processor handled gaming well, thermal throttling would cause lag spikes.\n\n**A before word**:\n\nAndroid Version: Android 14 with One UI 6  \nTemperature Monitoring: I use the PerfZ plugin on Game Launcher (Note: It's a bit inaccurate)  \nTesting Conditions: Ambient temperature of 22°C  \nThermal Management Tool: I use FineLock to manage GoodLock Guardians.\n\n**If Your Phone is Lagging Due to Thermal Throttling**:\n\nScreen Brightness: Higher brightness increases heat. Aim for 25%-50% for better temperature control. With 25%-50% brightness, I saw a temperature difference of around 2°C.\n\nPower Saving & Max Hz: This allows one to use power-saving and adjust the refresh rate to allow it to run at a higher refresh rate than 60hz in battery saving mode (I have not tested this myself). This will allow culling of background processes.\n\n**Here are the settings I use to balance performance and heat**: Processing Speed: Optimized for performance Thermal Guardian: Set to -2°C throttle (This triggers CPU throttling 2°C earlier than the default threshold to manage heat better)   \nRAM Plus: Turned off (If RAM is not a significant issue, this prevents unnecessary CPU overhead for writing and reading written RAM)   \nWi-Fi: Use 5GHz Wi-Fi for lower latency. You can switch to 2.5GHz Wi-Fi if latency or speed isn’t crucial and you want lower temperatures.   \n  \nAlternate Performance in Labs: I keep this setting off in the Samsung Game Launcher. It seemed to boost FPS but caused more heat, so I didn’t find it necessary to try further since that was what was holding my phone back.\n\n**Samsung Gaming Hub Settings**: I tested the Max FPS Mode in Game Booster Plus, but it increased temperatures significantly. While my games started smoothly, the higher heat output caused inconsistent FPS over time.   \nPriority Mode (with other plugins disabled) has provided me with the most consistent framerate with less heat. Additionally, I have Memory Guardian set to prioritize top app speed.   \nI also use Deep Sleep  for apps that don't need to run in the background, keeping only essential apps with notifications active.\n\n**Managing Extended Resource-Intensive Tasks**: I use the Bypass PD Setting in the Samsung Gaming Hub (This is supported on the Samsung S22 and newer models). You can also set the Bypass PD outside of the Gaming Hub using ADB commands or my preferred method via LADB. The commands are:   \nsettings put system pass\\_through 0   \nsettings put system pass\\_through 1   \nThis setting helps preserve battery, though I'm not sure if it generates more or less heat.\n\n**Trimming Running Services**: In Developer Options, you can check and trim unnecessary running services to free up resources and reduce background heat generation.\n\nI'd also like to know if anyone has found a way to allow the Aim Assist Plugin to display when I'm in Priority Mode.",

    "title": "OnePlus unveils its latest flagship smartwatch: OnePlus Watch 3",
    "text": "*(For some reason, OnePlus hasn't published this press release anywhere, so I'm pasting what they sent me via email in its entirety here.)*  \n\n---  \n\n*Offering exceptional battery life, new health monitoring capabilities and advanced fitness tracking, powered by Wear OS 5 by Google*\n\n**New York, NY, February 18, 2025** – Global technology brand OnePlus today launched its latest flagship smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, in the United States and Canada. Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nThanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\n\n“The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.” – said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.**\n\n**Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**\n\nOnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).\n\nThis has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.\n\nFurthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets — the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.\n\n**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**\n\nOnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.\n\nIn addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces \"360 Mind and Body\", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.\n\n**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**\n\nOnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.\n\n**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**\n\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).\n\n**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**\n\nWhen paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).\n\n**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**\n\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.\n\n**Price and Availability**\n\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.\n\nWarranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.\n\nOnePlus.com USA: [https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3)\nOnePlus.com Canada: [https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3)\n\n**###**\n\n**About OnePlus**\n\nOnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

    "text": "So, i'm gonna make this fast because this is supposed to be a quick take.\n\nI have bought a S22 Ultra back in may 2022, and it was the first ever flagship phone that i have used. Prior to that i had a Motorola Moto g4 (my first phone), and an Iphone Xr, so going back to android was pretty tough, but as the S22 Ultra was released with the S-pen, so i took the bet and decided to buy it.\n\nThe reason why i changed to the S25 Ultra is because my S22 Ultra's battery wasn't keeping up with my routine no more. Probably because of the degradation of the battery cycles, so i decided to get a new one, also, i got a very big discount over the S25 Ultra (less than half the price in my country), so i saw that as the perfect opportunity, plus, my brother needed a new phone so i gave him my old one.\n\nSince day one, i noticed a huge difference on the One IU 7. For me it feels like a brand new thing.\nThe cameras are great, the software feels a lot more responsive and fast, and even restarting the phone is quicker now.\nThe battery on this one, despite having the same capacity can provide a lot more screen time to me (like three times more), and it also feels less hot on the hand.\n\nAs a big S-pen fan since i firstly got my hands in it, i felt a little bit dissapointed on Samsung for removing the bluetooth capabilities of the pen, but if the pen is still there, it's already going to be suffient to 90% of my needs, so it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI think that this phone could be a lot better, yes, and that Samsung played it very safe this year, but i can still appreciate the fact that this feels a lot better than my old phone.\nThe S22 Ultra is still very good today, but i think that compared to the s25 Ultra, it just loses a little bit of it's bright.\n\nIn summary:\nThe S25 Ultra is very good, but very expensive, and it cannot take wireless photos with the S-pen, but it feels very nice anyways.",

I do hope they add it at some point, but Apple being Apple, I'm not holding my breath. \n\nIt would be nice if I could get it to run on my Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, but it won't accept my correctly typed email and password. My guess is that Amazon's brain-dead forked version of Android is too old for the Apple app. It's not a big deal as I've finally given up on Android tablets and am going to buy an iPad Mini one of these days.",

Not only do they have a huge amount of detail - much more detail than Google Maps, they also have hiking and biking trails, and the ability to record and overlay all the routes and paths and trails you've taken.\n\nIt also works great with Android Auto and has recently become my default mapping application. \n\nI just wanted to recommend this one, and get some suggestions on other alternatives to Google Maps on Android that people out there might be using. \n\nThe cons - it does cost money, and it does not appear to have real time location updates or traffic notifications. \n\nThat said I am really liking the extra detail, but would also like to hear some suggestions of alternative navigation apps if you've got em, ideally with anroid auto and real time location sharing.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT - OsmAnd DOES appear to have real time updates for speed traps with navigation. Gaia is more for hiking and recording everywhere you've been. For now OsmAnd + Gaia seem to be a great combo for me in and later out of the car.",

    "text": "Just saw a LTT video and thought I could jot down my every man's experience after a week. I've gone all in to the Google ecosystem from when I had android way way back but switched to iOS for the family and friends. Switched back for ME lol. I love the phone btw, everything except the listed stuff below.\n\n- I miss apple wallet. I don't fly anywhere or need a digital ID but I DO go to the movies often with my kids. It was surprising to me that Google Wallet or Samsung wallet doesn't have a Ticket-To-Wallet experience like Fandango does with Apple. On Google Wallet I had to take a screen shot of the ticket and save it as a pass and Google's AI made a neat pass for me.\n\n-I guess apple NFC for payments is always on? It was cool to see i can manually turn it in off I guess to save battery. I eventually figured out I can just do a routine that when wallet is open NFC is on and when I close the app NFC turns off.\n\n-My bank gave me a gigantic issue with Google Wallet. I guess from having Apple wallet for years, a few transactions kept getting declined. I had to call the bank like YES ITS ME and respond to emails and text. Annoying.\n\n-Google Home works slightly better on iOS and that's comical to me. I'm on a google device aren't I? It should work the same or better. On iOS I can control everything from anywhere. On my Samsung I can do everything except control volumes. For some reason it says I HAVE to be home and it's small but important to me. And it just loads faster when I go in to look at devices vs on my Samsung it kinda takes a few seconds to \"think\" before it shows me light colors, speaker volumes, if tvs are on ect.\n\n-Youtube works a little odd. So on iOS if I want the video to float around as I navigate the phone, that's automatic. On my Samsung I had to go turn that on somewhere. Now, on iOS when I wanna end the app all together, I just swipe it away. On my phone if I'm on the app itself, I can swipe away. If I'm on the floating screen, I have to open back up to full screen and swipe away, and when I go to the running apps screen, YouTube is still there so it's another swipe away to end it.\n\n-The camera is a mixed bag. My wife still has iOS so I took a noob camera comparison and for my moving kids, iOS camera is tops. And I can video them if I want and take screenshots of the video. On my phone, it's rare to take a good still shot of a movie subject, even with the camera assit plug in to cut down shutter speed. (Although it helped to have it on). But the still pictures are just chefs kiss.\n\nHaving a great time otherwise. Battery lasts like all day, screen is better, animations are faster. Keyboard options are better. Customization is tops.",

    "text": "I’ve been thinking about Google and Samsung’s promise to support their latest phones for 7 years. On paper, it sounds great, but will the updates actually be useful, or will they just slow down devices like some claim Apple does? \n\nMost Android brands like OnePlus and Xiaomi barely offer 3-4 years, so this is a huge step. But will they actually keep it up long-term?",

    "title": "OnePlus Watch 3 Set to Launch on February 18 in North America and Europe",
    "text": "(*For some reason, OnePlus hasn't published this press release anywhere, so I'm pasting what they sent me via email in its entirety here.*)  \n\n---  \n\n*Offered in two striking colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium – it maintains its industry leading 16-day battery life*  \n\n**New York, February 10** – Global technology brand OnePlus today announced the upcoming launch of its latest premium flagship smartwatch -- OnePlus Watch 3. With a focus on seamlessly integrating cutting-edge sensors, industry-leading battery life and advanced health algorithms into an elegant design, OnePlus Watch 3 is set to launch in the United States, Canada, and European markets on February 18.  \n\n**Unrivaled Battery Performance** \n\nOnePlus Watch 3 is designed to support a demanding lifestyle. It continues to deliver industry-leading battery life with an exceptional 16-day use in power saver mode, 5-day use (up to 120 hours) in smart mode, and features an incredibly fast 10-minute charge that powers the watch for a full day of use. \n\nThe smartwatch utilizes two distinct flagship chipsets – the **Snapdragon® W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU** Efficiency chipset. These chipsets power OnePlus Watch 3's **Dual-Engine Architecture** and ensure an optimal balance between long battery life and intelligent functionality. To increase power efficiency, the fabrication technique of the BES2800 chipset improved and is built on advanced 6nm FinFET. Additionally, it is equipped with the OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, the same technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13, which significantly boosts energy density for long-lasting power within a slim design. The battery capacity of OnePlus Watch 3 increased to **631mAh** from 500mAh in the previous edition. Not only has OnePlus increased OnePlus Watch 3’s operational speed, it also dramatically reduced power consumption.   \n\nMoreover, an optimized antenna for better power usage, and comprehensive WearOS optimization contribute to the OnePlus Watch 3's superior performance.\n\n**Technology Meets Elegance: Classic, Premium and Durable Design**  \n\nDesigned with a sophisticated, high-end finish, OnePlus Watch 3 keeps the iconic stainless steel casing from its previous model. A sleek, newly introduced titanium alloy bezel with a robust PVD coating enhances its elegance, while ensuring exceptional durability for daily use. The 2D Sapphire Crystal display not only delivers a brighter screen but also boasts impressive strength and longevity.\n\nOnePlus Watch 3 will be available in two stunning colors -- Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium. The Emerald Titanium watch features a silver titanium bezel and a stainless steel body, as well as a green fluororubber strap with a stainless steel buckle. This distinctive Emerald Titanium finish, which was inspired by nature, exhibits the ideal balance of dynamic athleticism, signifying development and energy.\n\nThe Obsidian model features a black titanium bezel and a stainless steel body, as well as a black fluororubber strap with a stainless steel buckle. This exquisite design is the perfect fusion of modern technology and understated elegance.\n\nFurther details of OnePlus Watch 3 will be revealed at launch, on February 18. Stay tuned for an insightful launch video with industry experts, which will be hosted on the official [OnePlus Europe YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@OnePlus_Europe/videos)\n\n**Disclaimers:**\n\n* Actual battery life varies depending on the features and apps used, frequency of calls and messages, number of times charged, and many other factors.\n\n* The 120 hours battery life claim is based on tests performed by OnePlus in laboratory conditions.

    "text": "I generally enjoy using my iphone, it's not perfect of course, but iOS is far from terrible. However, something I have personally found, is iOS seems to have some really inefficient/ineffective behaviours/ideas behind notification management. \n\nIs it just me, or is it infuriating how notifications will drop down in the exact same spot important UI elements live? Say I'm in an app, I want to go back, I go to click the arrow in the top corner (which is a bad place for this to live anyway), but at the exact moment I do this, a chat notification drops down and opens the chat that I wanted to ignore. \n\nStacked notifications look sort of visually appealing, but they're an awful way of dealing with several messages from several people in a single app. Why can't we have message threads bunch into single bubbles in a stack, so I can simply pull down, pop in, and see everything from each person arranged in an easy to digest manner? Maybe letting us set very subtle individual colour tints for each person (could be done via contacts?) in a stack to denote better what is going on. Who knows.\n\nOn this point, Apple Intelligence summaries are a great idea in theory, but generally suck when it mixes messages from multiple people, to make a quick sentence of no real value, or little sense. (I understand that is a work in progress though, and sometimes they're funny).\n\nWith the past addition of dynamic island, I imagine how neat it could be to have notifications pop up in that, image it expands out for a second to show the notification arrived, in the left corner it shows the app, in the right corner is shows the contact. That way a notification wouldn't affect the user, or get in the way, but if they wanted to quick view it, they could press and hold it to see the new messages drop down in a black box (as a thread, same as could be shown on lock screen) and quick press it to go direct into the chat.  \n\nAgain, might just be me but I feel like this is an area that iPhone feels a bit messy, inefficient and it shouldn't need to be the case.

I say probably at least once a day when I’m using certain apps, the screen malfunctions, where certain actions won’t work until closing and re opening the app.  For example on Reddit the screen will randomly bug out and the only screen response is scrolling.  The comment button won’t work, the x to leave a post won’t work, opening a new post won’t work.  It does this with YouTube where the only thing working is scrolling short to short but like, comment, subscribe, and the othe buttons fully won’t work.  I also know it is not my case or screen protector, as I have tested it on freeze by removing the case and screen protector so it’s only the screen.  And it still bugs where actions won’t work.

Then I accidentally ordered the 16 plus. I tried to return it in store, but it was a hassle and they wanted to charge money for a restocking fee since I bought it online. I decided to just stick with the plus instead of going through the return. \n\nI’m sitting here after two days and I’m annoyed at myself for not returning it. The plus is just too big. I got a pop socket, but it’s not helping. For people with small hands, do you get used to the screen size, even if it’s essentially unusable with one hand?",

    "text": "Edit: SOLVED\n\nNew iPhone user here (16 Pro Max). Last night I had Do Not Disturb enabled 11 pm to 9 am. Trying to get to sleep, I was playing a Solitaire game on my new iPhone. When I started a new game, loud ads blasted at full volume, disturbing me and waking up my spouse sleeping beside me. Quickly pressed the side On/Off on the iPhone to shut off the ad noise. The Sound, Vibration, and Notification settings on the game app were all set to Off.\n\nI just noticed there is a tiny Sound icon on the ad itself, but finding and pressing it before the ad starts blasting is impossible. Also, each ad that comes on resets the app's Sound icon to On.\n\nOn my old Pixel 6, DND actually kept this sort of ad noise off, so I was unprepared for the cacaphony on the iPhone.\n\nOther than remembering to press the iPhone RingOff or Volume Down buttons before bed every night, and then remembering to press them On again each morning, are there any iPhone settings I can use to emulate the Pixel's DND: turn ALL sounds on and off per the DND schedule, rather than relying every day on my (faulty) brain memory?",

    "title": "Switched from Pixel 5 to 16 Pro — camera is the biggest disappointment",
    "text": "**Why am I writing this?**\n\nBecause I can. And in case, if someone’s interested, I’m leaving it here. \n\nI'm a long time Android (Pixel) user who decided to try the 16 pro. Just out of curiosity. So, I've been using the iPhone 16 Pro for a week now, and I have some thoughts to share with you :).\n\n\n\n**1. Camera (RAW photography)**\n\n*A user:* expects pro features from a pro phone.\n\n*Apple:* bazinga!\n\nI'm writing about RAW photography because it's the only way to get decent photos on any phone.\n\nThe hardware is okay. Nothing special. Software is not good enough. I wouldn’t call it a “Pro”. And I wouldn’t recommend buying an iPhone if taking good photos on a phone is a priority.\n\nBoth *48mp 1x* and *48mp 0.5x* modules are a bit softer than I expected: the main module on 16 pro is softer than the main module on a good old Pixel 5. Ultrawide shots are similar. Also, the special pixel layout for those 48mp sensors introduces some artifacts (something like color fringing + oversharpening) which is especially noticeable on small details like tree branches or wires. It seems to me that the 48mp choice is for both main and wide modules is either the dumb marketing choice or just a supply chain issue. I don’t see any practical benefits from having a 48mp: no details, and pictures are quite noisy. I’d much prefer having a 12mp sensor without pixel binning, then 48mp sensor of the same size. And perhaps a bit smaller aperture to have a sharper image.\n\n*5x 12mp* module is better. It has more sharpness (actual details) and less noise than the other two.\n\nFrom the software perspective, it’s a shame. The phone is called a “Pro”, but the standard camera software doesn’t even have ISO/exposure/focus sliders. How perverse. A reader of this article may point out that third-party software exists. Yes, and some of them are sweet. But for some unknown reason Apple only allows 1s exposure time for third-parties which is… Funny? “Take total\n\nCamera Control” they said, right? No, Apple, no, no, Apple, that was so not right!\n\nFew words about ProRAW. It automatically applies that ugly noise reduction which kills all tiny color details. And of course, I have no choice other than shooting regular single frame RAW photos using third-party apps, so there’s a lot of noise due to the lack of photo stacking and taking the good data out of each frame. Apple’s ProRAW merges multiple frames, but then it adds stupid noise reduction on top, which is baked into the RAW data and cannot be undone. For comparison, Google Camera is far better in this regard because it leaves the noise that’s left after merging (and with it all the tiny color details and richer palette), so the RAW result looks very natural, but much cleaner than a single frame dng. And because of this, my Pixel 5 produces better looking RAW photos on the main module than iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nTo sum up, I can say that the only way to take a natural looking RAW photo on iPhone is by using other camera apps which allow saving unprocessed dng files. And then applying Lightroom’s “AI denoiser”l. Or, after Lightroom color editing, merge multiple shots in Photoshop using “Median stack mode”.\n\nAs for the videos, ProRes Log format is great. But once again. Let me disable noise reduction. I know what I’m doing!\n\n\n\n**2. Ergonomics**\n\nEven though I have a smaller model, 200g + rectangular edges make it feel like a brick in the hand. And the center of mass feels a bit too high, even though the phone itself could be perfectly balanced. Slippery glass on the back doesn’t help either. It all looks great on the pictures and videos, but practically, this design is inconvenient. It’s anti-human. And it’s a shame that everyone started copying Apple in this area. In my perfect world, the portable device should be light and comfortable.\n\nCamera bumps are getting ridiculous nowadays. So what that the sensors are larger? Photos look as horrible as they looked 5 years ago. Overprocessed mess with compressed dynamic range (BeCAuSe thEy mUsT LoOk HDRy!!! ) and low details. The same situation with other vendors. They just hardly take advantage of the large sensors (except for the holly Google Camera RAWs).\n\n\n\n**3. Face ID ☺️😍🙌🤩🤗✨❤️😎😄🎉**\n\nIT’S AWESOME, AND I HONESTLY DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY NOBODY’S COPYING THIS APPROACH.\n\nThe best part is that it doesn’t require any efforts from me to use this feature. It just works. Fast and reliable. I don’t care that there’s a cutout in the screen if it makes my life easier.\n\n\n\n**4. Software**\n\nAnimations. Even though not all the animations are perfectly smooth all the time (a bit strange with such powerful CPU), The general approach to animating UI is the best. It’s fluent. It’s interesting. It’s beautiful. It’s unbelievable that WW3 is coming in the same timeline where these animations exist. And it’s not only Apple’s software. In 99% of cases, other apps look and feel noticeably better on iOS compared to Android. Is it possible to learn this power?\n\nScrolling bothers me on iOS. It’s too slow. Even when I try to scroll fast, it just won’t. I think this should be changed for the good of a mankind.\n\nWidgets are far better implemented on iOS. I like that widget sidebar and how consistent they look and align with icons. Android fanboys are often mocking Apple for bringing certain features too late, but in this case, it’s better being late than making widgets like on Android (mostly useless ugly crap).\n\nWHERE IS BACK GESTURE???\n\nAlso, I don’t like that I cannot open quick settings swiping down somewhere on the home screen. Instead, it opens a search menu, which also has a “seach” button at the bottom of the screen. Why does Apple want me to use search so much?🤔 I want to use quick settings!\n\nThe overall software experience for me is mixed. Some parts of the OS are designed and work perfectly well, while others are strange, inconvenient, and unintuitive.\n\n\n\n**5. Apple Intelligence**\n\nIt ought to be here, but it isn't.\n\n\n\n**6. Am I going to return it?**\n\nI think I’m going to return it.",

It went okay, but the camera got blurry, just after the repair was made. I used a hot gun to evaporate the bubbles under the lense, which made the blur disappear .\n\nThen after a few minutes the camera started shaking, but without any sound. But then after a few hours, whenever I opened the camera by Snapchat or the normal camera, it started making a weird mechanical shaking sound. If I were to shake the phone, I can could hear something shaking inside the phone. I think it could be some of the glass or metal, which got under the camera, as there is a gap just next to the camera.\n\nHas anyone experienced the same before? Btw, I burned the flashlight, which I will fix, but could that be the reason?\n\niPhone 12 Pro IOS 18.3.1\n\nThanks in advance!",

The connection doesn't come back for a long time, turning the phone on and off helps, but it's a nuisance while driving when you lose coverage.

I want to backup my iPhone on the Mac and then restore that backup onto the new iPhone as I think that might be the best method as I will still keep my data on the old phone.\n\nI have a phone backup on my Mac from two years ago, will this new backup replace that one? I don't want it to use up double the space on my Mac.\n\nI wanted to update my MacBook anyway, but I can do that sooner for this process. I am just really wondering what are some issues that I might encounter during this transfer process?\n\nI would rather not use iCloud and I believe that would take a bit of time anyway to set up.\n\nMy other question is - will the Whatsapp app restore fully (all chats, all media) on the new iPhone with this backup option, transffering the backup from Mac? I will choose the encrypted option on the backup as well.\n\nStupid questions, but is there any way I can accidentally delete the data on my old phone when backing up on the Mac? Or deleting the Mac backup when restoring on the new iPhone?\n\nThank you!",

In the morning hours I saw that it isn't connected to Wifi anymore. Macbook and iPad are connected without any issues. iPad on 18.3.1 and Macbook on 15.3.2.\n\nWhen I manually try to enter my wifi network I get a response which says:  \n*Unable to join the network*  \n*\"name\\_of\\_my\\_network\"*  \n*This network is operating on Wi-Fi channels in use by several other nearby networks.*  \n*Restarting your wireless router may allow it to automatically choose the best channel to use, and may resolve this problem.*\n\nWhat I did to troubleshoot:\n\n* reset iPhone's network settings\n* restart iPhone\n* hard restart iPhone\n* toggle of and on the airplane mode over 30 seconds\n* restart router\n* change channels of 2,4GHz and 5GHz channels in the router settings\n\nIt does not reflect any order but I usually restart devices after major changes just to make sure all is fine. Followed along general advices from Apple's support page and users with similar issues.\n\nNone of the steps fixed my issue with the iPhone since the update. I fear that there is something more complicated to deal with. I hope someone has another good idea what I can try to fix it myself. Other then that I think I have to completely reinstall the iPhone =.=\n\nThanks in advance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrwxgg9581pe1.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f41e12da706250fa9836f78fba11c4142a551110\n\n\\[SOLVED\\] Update: 16.03.2025: Also remembered that I can generate a QR-Code in the web interface of my router to be scanned and used as quick login.

Fast forward many more years and now they're teens who don't want to share one ID because it syncs photos and music onto all devices. Is there a way to create separate IDs for each of them without losing their apps, photos, saved data, etc.? Thanks!",

    "text": "Ever since Instagram shifted to pushing reels, suggested content, and endless ads on iPhone, I've found it harder to just keep up with my actual friends. The constant notifications about who viewed my stories and read my messages was also creating unnecessary social pressure.\n\nSo I built a tool for myself called InstaPlus that transforms how Instagram works on iPhone:\n\n* Disabled those anxiety-inducing read receipts so I can check messages without pressure\n* Removed screenshot notifications so I can save posts without alerting everyone\n* Added Face ID protection for when friends borrow my phone\n* Completely hid the reels tab and explore page to focus just on my feed and messages\n* Created confirmation dialogs to prevent those embarrassing accidental likes on old posts\n* Added the ability to download photos/videos with a simple long-press\n\nThe difference it's made for my social media experience on iPhone has been incredible. Instead of endless scrolling through algorithm-recommended content, I now just open the app, check updates from friends, respond to messages, and put my phone away.\n\nI've made it available for other iPhone users on Gumroad if anyone's interested. Installation is pretty simple with Sideloadly.\n\nHas anyone else found ways to make their iPhone apps less distracting and more focused on real connections? What other iPhone apps do you wish you could customize like this?\n\nI put it on Gumroad as [cupidapps.gumroad.com/l/instaplus](http://cupidapps.gumroad.com/l/instaplus) if you're interested.",

I review them and decide what to keep, whether that’s back on my desktop, on my phone, or on another cloud service where I manually copy them over instead of deciding after whether that it wasn’t a good idea on a Canadian data plan (I don’t see how it could be).\n\nThe images are in my photos, on the phone.  I can select them.  iMovie won’t let me proceed with importing them to the project. \n\n So, this has escalated from mildly annoying pop-up to refusing to import media from within the same phone?",

Last week I updated from an iPhone 13 Pro to a 16 pro and ever since my payments have been wrecked. \n\nThe same credit card I’ve used for Apple Pay for years….if I try to buy or rent a movie or download an app it says my payment account has been disabled and then it tries to get me to enter a new card, only my card is already in my wallet. I’ve removed all of them but when I add them again it says “this card is already in your account (or wallet)”, or it asks me to verify the card by entering the numbers again, only to tell me that the card is already in my wallet. \n\nI entered into a tech support chat but the person was useless. I asked to have my case given a ticket and escalated to advanced tech support. However, when they call me back, I have to press 1 on my iPhones keypad, but apples own customer service system can’t hear or detect it when I use the keypad, so I’m locked out of tech support calls.\n\nI’m seriously thinking of dumping this and buying a flip phone. Apple has added so many convoluted and useless features to this yet have failed to fix the basics. I don’t want a pixel or Samsung phone. I don’t know what to do, this is wrecked beyond repair. I can’t talk to anyone on the phone bc pressing numbers on apples iPhone keypad doesn’t work lol. \n\nSo disgusted. Thank god I got this upgrade for $2 a month. I’d just go back to my 13 pro but apple has somehow managed to destroy my account. \n\nSorry for the rant, I’m an it professional and remember a time when my elderly parents could use iPhones bc they were intuitive.

    "text": "Hello there,\n\nI own an iRig Stream and just ordered an iRig Pre 2 that hasn't arrived yet. I also have iRig Recorder Free installed on my iPhone 12 Pro running iOs 17.7.2.\n\nMy goal is to record an xlr microphone into a recording app on the phone, and later export the recording as a WAV file. All the recording and exporting needs to be at sample rate 48kHz and bit depth 24-bit.\n\nI was thinking of connecting the iRig Pre 2 to the phone via an Apple 3.5mm Headset to Lightning adapter that I have. For starters I cannot confirm if the analog to digital converter inside the adapter will convert the analog signal from the microphone to 48kHz 24-bit to be recorded. Then, I understand that if I pay 4€ I can export in WAV in iRig Recorder. The free app says the quality of the audio is on HIGH, so 48kHz 24-bit.\n\nIs there a simple way to do true 48kHz 24-bit recording and wav exporting (without any kind of resampling in any way) with my setup? Maybe with another app? Will it work if I just pay the 4€ and get WAV exporting in iRig Recorder free? I also thought about connecting the iRig Pre 2 to the iRig Stream Headset/Phones 3.5mm jack, but the iRig Pre 2 outputs line level signal (it's a preamp powered by 2 AA batteries), so it is much more power then the iRig Stream expects to receive on the female 3.5mm jack (and unmatched impedance), am I correct? What are your thoughts about this matter?\n\nIn another topic, I do not seem to be able to enable \"Lossless audio\" on the Settings->Music tab of my phone (there is no \"Audio Quality\" menu visible, and the max setting is \"High Quality\" AAC 256 kbps). Can this somehow be ignored and being able to export to WAV 48kHz 24-bit, using the Apple's adapter?\n\nAnd for last, I also do not seem to be able to connect a pair of bluetooth headphones to the phone and being able to playback the phone's sound independent from the recording setup. In the same topic, in the iRig Pre 2 the direct monitoring switch will let me choose between direct monitoring of the xlr microphone (in a pure analog way), and listening to the phone's sound (going thru the digital to analog converter on the Apple's adapter) with wired headphones connected to the 3.5mm female, am I correct?\n\nI am asking for your help here, please. I would really appreciate if someone could clarify.\n\nThank you!",

The iPhone 16 Plus itself is only costing me about $2.00 every month for 36 months ontop of my regular wireless bill from Verizon.   Not a bad deal. \n\nThis was my first time upgrading from an old iPhone to a new iPhone. (My last upgrade was from a Samsung to my 11, and getting all my old apps back and working was a colossal pain in the ass. \n\nThis upgrade was a relative breeze. \nI choose to transfer all my old data directly from my old 11. \nMy only pain point during the transfer was during my new 16’s upgrade to iOS 18.3.2. \n\nAfter the initial download of the update, instead of seeing the typical installation progress bar that shows the percentage of the upgrade done, I was shown a “spinning wheel” in the bottom left corner of the upgrade screen for at least 20 minutes. It wasn’t showing any type of progress bar. \n\nIt didn’t look right to me so I did a shutdown and restart of the new 16. \n\nAfterwards, it seemed to walk me through the initial setup again with similar steps, perhaps not all of them. Then when it got to the 18.3.2 upgrade screen, after the download of the upgrade file, I saw the typical progress bar showing the installation. \n\nThis DID take quite a bit of time, but at least I saw the progress. \n\nAfterwards, my new 16  was done with both the iOS upgrade and the transfer of data and I was good to go.  \n\nAll my apps transferred over including my DUO tokens which surprised me. (I needed to confirm this transfer on my old phone.)\n\nMy last snag was the actual activation of my new 16. I had thought that would automagically happen but it didn’t. I was seeing the SOS status on my 16.  I needed to call Verizon and walk through an automated activation of new 16. \nThat took like 5 minutes. \n\nSo overall a pretty painless experience and I’m very happy with the 16. \n\nAnyone else experience the 18.3.2 upgrade snag while transferring their old phone to their new phone?\n\nThank you again for letting me share my experience.",

My cellular capability is no longer functional. I took it into an “authorized repair” spot in a Best Buy and without recognizing my phone was still operational and the front was somehow in tact, the guy whipped out a binder and told me it was $650 for a full replacement. I did not have a lot of faith in his recommendation - there was nothing “Apple authorized” about the appointment.\n\nI once worked in an Apple Store. I’m aware that sometimes you can replace parts or secure connections. \n\nSo my question is can the antenna be replaced/repaired along with the back of the screen? If so, I’ll hike my booty out to the lakeside mall to get an appointment at the store itself. Otherwise, I’d like to avoid wasting time. Thank you!\n\nTL;DR back screen shattered and antenna doesn’t work, otherwise 16 Pro is still in okay condition. Will Apple Store repair or only replace?",

The first support agent said that it might because of the software problem and I should update my device to the latest IOS. It didn’t work 😩\nThen I made an appointment with Apple Care, the receptionist said it got damaged maybe from the laser or something, so the lens was broke!?!?!??!! Did not even ask the technician to check it first. Then she said that even with Warranty, I still have to replace it with an additional fee, also she said I shouldn’t take pictures in the Club or Concert or anywhere they have strong lights or Lasers. Since when I have to care so much while using my own Iphone???? I doubt about the sustainability of Apple Devices.\nI was thinking like ok maybe many people got this problem before, i agreed to replace a new lens cause there was no other options and they charged me around 200$ and I have to let them took my old lens. Otherwise it would be around 240$ for the replacement fee.\nWhat was that? I bought this 14 Promax 256GB Purple Model at somewhere around 1000$, andI purchased it since 2023, only 2 years later i have to pay 200$ and let them recall the old lens only with 40$ 🤡 which made this more ridiculous.\nVery good business Apple 👍🏻 soooo…I will use this phone until it very last breath, will not upgrade to new version anymore, I am frustrated they even asked me to rate 5 star for their services 😤\nAnyone got same problem?",

    "text": "Hey guys, I’m new to this subreddit and I have a big question.\n\nSo, I got my iPhone 16 Pro back in October, and everything was working fine at first. But lately, I’ve noticed that my phone vibrates when playing music at high volume, or even at medium volume. I can feel the vibration on the sides and on the back, right above the Apple logo. It’s not like a strong vibration that makes the phone move or like the one you get with notifications—it’s more subtle but still noticeable.\n\nI wanted to know if this is normal or if I’m just being overly picky. For context, my phone has never been dropped or anything like that—I’ve been super careful with it. I also asked a friend who has a new 16 Pro Max, and I could feel the same vibration on their phone too. Maybe I’m just being too sensitive, but I’ve been wondering if it’s because of the bass intensity. If that’s the case, is there a way to reduce it?\n\nAttached some reference images.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5dqvpjtrsoe1.png?width=369&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c7e184b9f1d02b958f86322faedebcf75960562",

When I was in Japan, somehow I was able to install the airalo esim, not sure if it was due to being outside Verizon's area or possibly due to restarting the phone, although multiple restarts did not help previously.\n\nI am now back in the states and had a physical verizon sim installed for my primary. I still want to be able to add esim's, however I am unable to do so.\n\nAfter clicking \"setup an Esim\", I get stuck on a screen that says \"contact Verizon\". There's no where to upload a QR code or anything, no way around it. \n\nVerizon says the phone is fully unlocked. Google support says the problem is with Verizon who may have have the phone locked, which I'm inclined to believe given that I was able to install another Esim when outside the country.\n\nAnyone know how to fix the issue ?\n\nThanks",

    "text": "So I have been working on this for awhile, and it's infuriating. My son has a pixel 7 for pokémon go, duilingo, etc. I also set it up so that he can use Google chat to message me while I'm at work. The phone does not have a SIM card and is connected to wifi for use as a small tablet. The phone is under his account, which is a kids account and I use family link. The problem is that western you go into a chat on his pixel 7, he can send messages, but the icon to the right of the text field to send images and the microphone are missing. If I use the plus on the left of the text field, I can select a photo to send, but it just sits there after you hit send and never actually sends. I have searched and searched for an answer and can not find it. He also has a Samsung galaxy tablet that is also under his account in family link. On thy tablet, he can use Google chat and the icons are there and work. I had checked settings in family link they are the same on both devices, the permissions on the devices are the same. I can not find why the icons will not appear and function on his pixel 7. I can't imagine the absence of a SIM card matters, as it is using wifi and also the galaxy tab does not have a SIM and works fine. And yes, I know the easy answer is for him to use the galaxy tab, but that isn't the point. The pixel 7 SHOULD function the same. I have cleared cache, data, uninstalled, reinstalled, nothing. Any ideas?",

To compare, I went to Best Buy to take a look at the 9/9 Pro demo units, which both had the mesh on their bottom speaker. In addition to my unit not having one, I also noticed that the actual speaker grill is smaller than the cutout itself, with a piece of what appears to be plastic (that maybe holds the mesh?) on the side. I'm just wondering if this some sort of defect (on my second unit nonetheless after I had to RMA my first one). The speaker works normally, but without a mesh it'd mean that dust and particles would get in there a lot easier, and maybe this could also affect the water resistance?",

    "text": "Hello! I've reached the boundaries of my knowledge to solve this problem so I'm turning here for help. Short story: Feb 2025 Pixel Drop got my Pixel 6 stuck in a bootloop. Google support was useless, so I went to the repair shop Google told me to go to and talked with the techs for a while. I decided to try and handle this myself after they showed me the Pixel Repair Tool and said that's all they would use and saved myself the money. Here's what I did:\n\n1. Got the device into fastboot and did a factory reset. This didn't work.\n2. Tried the [Pixel Repair tool](https://pixelrepair.withgoogle.com/) and was able to successfully reinstall the OS and get the device set up.\n3. Decided, in my infinite wisdom, to try and reinstall the Drop on a clean factory install after setting the phone up. Bootloop again.\n4. Used the Repair tool again, but noticed that the fastboot menu this time said something like \"device status: locked\" when before it said unlocked. Repair tool lost the connection with the device once it reached the installation phase. Repeated a couple of times because I thought it really was just a connection issue.\n5. Then tried the [Android Flash Tool](https://flash.android.com/) with the [factory image](https://developers.google.com/android/images) and received a message that the device was locked.\n6. Tried messing around with the adb and fastboot CLI tools per factory image page and [Flash with Fastboot page](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/test/running) and got the message \"remote: Flashing Unlocked is not allowed\"\n\nI'm a semi-professional Android dev but have never really messed with the AOSP or any other OS-related stuff, just app dev. As best as I can understand, it seems like the bootloader is now locked from OEM flashing and I cannot unlock it without being able to access the developer options, which the bootloop prevents. Is there any chance of recovering the phone or is it pretty well bricked now?\n\nI did have it backed up and already bought another phone (8a) as my daily use phone. I restored from the backup so I'm not too upset if the 6 is a lost cause, but I was looking forward to having a new testing phone after confirming the bootloop cause and what I thought was a solid fix. Either way, I've learned some new stuff about how the firmware and OS work!",

It was usually fine with the xm3s but the buds 2 pros would always have static when taking a call and coming back to regularly playing audio. I eventually got sick of the issue and went online looking for a fix and somebody told me to change the map value in the Bluetooth audio settings in developer settings I changed it from 1.2 to 1.4 I tried to reset all my settings and pair everything the same and I found other issues which were mitigated by changing something with disabling Bluetooth le hardware offload, but this left my headphones not sounding very good. So I set it back to 1.2 and ever since all Bluetooth problems have been resolved it never cuts out anymore. It connects faster than ever, and doesn't have issues when switching between phone calls and media. I was so close to sending this phone back I like everything else about it but this issue was a deal breaker for me luckily it's now fixed",

So i was watching a movie on my laptop with my earphones connected, they are no faulty (the earphones), and the audio was playing directly to my ears and not from the laptop speakers. My pixel 7 was may maybe 3 feet away from me, so the audio from my earphones can't reach it that much right? BUT the now playing recognized the song that the movie was playing... HOW?? How is this possible?? The audio from my earphones wasn't loud enough to reach my phone? My phone wasn't connected to the laptop or the earphones either?? So how did this happen??",

    "text": "Hi there,\n\nFor some time now (I'd say 2 years), I have the feeling my background applications are not running as they should be.\n\nFor example :\n\n* I'm tracking my journeys with Google Maps, and it sometimes seems unaware how I magically travel from point A to point B in one or two hours - although my device is on, with good network signal : I'm often cycling while listening to podcasts or live radio, I'm 100% sure my Pixel is alive but does not update its location\n* I'm waiting for a notification (from Discord or Element instant messaging because I expect a message or a game I'm playing), and the notification will only appear if I open the application\n* I have a Nest camera that uses my Pixel to determine my current location and decide if it should be on or off, and will trigger a notification to my wife's phone when I come home because there's a stranger (me) in the living room. If I open the app: I receive the notification, and it finally realizes I'm home and disables the camera.\n\nThe weird thing is that I have changed my phone twice since this problem started appearing (upgraded from Pixel 6 to Pixel 8, than had my Pixel 8 replaced because of a screen issue) and I still have this problem. But I have used the native feature to transfer data and it might have saved/restored a wrong setting.\n\nI've checked my individual app settings, and global phone settings for battery optimization / location settings / notification settings, multiple times, and really can't find out what could be causing this.\n\nMy impression is that :\n\n* Applications I've used less than a few hours ago work properly in background and manage to know my current location / receive and send notifications\n* Some applications (Gmail, Whatsapp, Signal, Messages) work 100% of the time, not sure if because I use them often enough or they managed to have the good setting/privilege.\n* I might solve the issue with a factory reset but I would really love to avoid reinstalling and resetting all my apps\n\n  \nWould you have any idea what kind of setting I should check before giving up?\n\nI've really been looking for solutions for a long time and I'm quite puzzled now.\n\nThanks a lot !",

    "text": "I've been an iphone user nearly my whole life until last year when I went to a Pixel 7a from an iPhone 13 Pro and I much prefer android and will be staying. However, I can't help but notice that for example scrolling through Spotify albums, when I go on the album and go back to the all the albums, it throws me back up to the top of the albums list, not where I previously left off, so it gets kinda frustrating when it happens every single time when I jump from album to album. On iPhone I have never had that. That's only one of a few examples.\n\nIs this a Tensor chip limitation? Is this something that happens on other androids too? I wouldn't be surprised if this is an android thing since there are a lot of androids and to maintain a perfect build for them all is very hard and would likely cost a lot of money. I would like to think it's a Tensor thing because even on an iPhone XS (which I have as a spare), when I go on an album and swipe back, i'm still where I left off. It's a nearly 7 year old device and it's performance is pretty much almost on par with my pixel. Gets less warm too.",

    "text": "Hey r/GooglePixel, I’m losing my mind with my Pixel 8 and need some help (or at least to rant). The charging speed has been glacial lately—like 16.1%/hour slow, which is absurd for a phone that’s supposed to handle 27W. Plus, it’s overheating like it’s trying to cook itself, hitting 39-41°C (102-105°F), and the power drops to a pathetic 1.7W. I’m using the stock charger and cable, and I’m from Hyderabad, India, where it’s pretty hot (and it’s gonna be hot for a while), but even when I try charging in the coolest room I can find with the case off, it’s still a hot mess (literally).\n\n\nHere’s the data from AccuBattery Pro:\nTotal charge: 60% (2,740 mAh) in 3h 43m\nScreen on: 6% (283 mAh) in 33m\nScreen off: 54% (2,457 mAh) in 3h 10m\nCharge speed: 16.1%/h (735 mA average)\nBattery wear: 0.95 cycles (40% to 100%), efficiency 63%\n\nI get that the temperature might be forcing it to throttle the charging speed to save the battery, but 39-41°C doesn’t seem that extreme—or is it? People said the Tensor G3 was supposed to be better with thermals than the G2,  I’ve rebooted, charged with the screen off, and killed all background apps, but nothing helps.Is this happening to anyone else with a Pixel 8? I’ve seen older posts about overheating and battery issues, but I figured Google would’ve patched this by now. I’m on the latest Android version (March 2025), so I’m out of ideas. Should I bother with Google Support, or is this just how it’s gonna be? I’m seriously considering ditching this phone—I can’t take it anymore.Any advice, fixes, or shared misery would be awesome.

    "text": "I've owned a Pixel Tablet with the dock since it was released.\n\nIt's a bit late but I'd like to share my experience with it, and my disappointment with its dock features which I initially expected Google would have fixed, but I've now lost hope in that regard.\n\nFirst of all, I'll say I think as a tablet it is great. Great screen, battery, pixel experience, fast for my liking, sound is good etc...\n\nHowever, as a dock, it quite frankly sucks. It is a major step back compared to a simple home speaker like the Google Nest Hub or even a Google home mini that doesn't even have a screen.\n\nFirst and foremost: I'm not home alone. I expect my dock to recognize multiple people voices in my home, not just mine. And the Pixel Tablet simply cannot do that. If you set-up multiple users in your tablet only one voice match works. If I switch to another user and I enable that user voice match it disable the main user voice match and viceversa.\nI cannot have dock widgets with calendar for all users. It is simply not designed for a multi user experience. Which I don't know how else to put it: is completely absurd for an home device.\n\nThis isn't all. With a nest device I can set it up to automatically send music or videos to another device, with the Pixel Tablet I can't, the option simply is not there.\n\nAnd finally, with the replacement of the old Google assistant with the new Gemini it lost even more features.\n\nI cannot believe these things weren't brought up in a quality testing phase. Someone at Google made the informed and conscious decision to sell an half baked product overselling it with no plans to fix it later.\n\nI feel scammed by Google for this. I always only had pixels devices, I advocate for them because I do think they are the best android devices on the market and got all my parents and several friends to get pixels smartphones. In my opinion it is worse than the Pixel 4 recent battery mess. At least there Google acted as a safety measure for device owners and provided a compensation.\nWith the Pixel Tablet dock Google simply oversold an half backed feature and didn't even try to fix it afterwards, it actually made it worse.\n\nIf anyone from the Google Pixel team is listening: this is how you start to put cracks in your loyal user base. It is what still separates Google from Apple as a company for hardware.\n\nThese are all fixable issues, via software. And if you fix them for Pixel Tablet devices you fix them for your future devices as well.\n\nThe #teampixel hashtag deserves better than this.",

    "text": "Hey everyone, pixel 7 user for a little over two years here \nI've been dreaming about having a pixel phone ever since the 4 came out - but it was only in 2023 that I could afford my first one.\nIt was great at first, especially the camera (which is still amazing) but now I've been haveing way too many issues to justify my next phone being a pixel. Here they are:\n - The battery: it was livable at first but now I can't take it. I live in a fairly hot country and my phone can't even last the day on TWO FULL CHARGES. That's as annoying as it sounds.\n- The screen: I was hugely disappointed when I first got the phone. The 7's pixel density is just too low to go unnoticed and it's really annoying.\n- The software: yeah this is the last thing I'd have expected to be an issue on a Google phone but it is. The apps just don't work well. My alarm has randomly decided to fail me 4 times already because \"do not disturb was activated\". It wasn't. An alarm shouldn't be stopped by do not disturb anyways. It also didn't give reasons sometimes. Also apps just don't work well. Instagram, youtube, twitter, WhatsApp, I have to relaunch them way too often because they crash or stop loading.\n- The chip: come on Google just give up on tensor it's ass. We shouldn't tolerate a mid range chip on a premium phone.\nIf Google doesn't fix these issues with pixel 10 I'll probably get a Xiaomi 15 ultra or something. A phone with a good battery, chip and screen and almost better cameras.\nOkay thanks for reading my rant. If anyone has fixes for these issues I'd gladly listen",

Since then it hasn't resolved by restarting or factory reset and from what I've heard my only option is to give it to service centre and hope they don't charge me as much as the phone is now worth. \nThanks for nothing pixel, I was a huge pixel fan and I never thought I'd say this but I'm switching to Samsung.",

Ich habe noch nicht weiter die Details prüfen können, aber lt. Copiloten ist das dann wohl SDR Farbprofil. Aber sieht gut aus.  \nWill man HDR Material korrekt interpretieren, geht man mit der rechten Maustaste auf den Clip im Projekt nach \"Interpret footage\", und sicherstellen, dass der Farbraum richtig erkannt wurde, also in diesem Fall Rec.2100 HLg.  \n\n\nWeiterhin gibts noch ein Programm innerhalb Premiere welches Lumetri heißt. Dort kann man ebenfalls Farben naturgetreu vom HDR in den SDR Farbraum mappen.  \n\n\nHabe selbt noch nicht alles verifizieren können, aber immerhin ists schon brauchbar geworden.

But I can't figure out how to change it for my pixel 9.\n\nI'll try to explain this as best I can\n\nBasically, I get all notifications coming through just fine, no issues there. But when my screen goes completely dark... nothing. The notificaitons come through but I have no way of knowing unless I wake my screen. Notifications don't \"wake\" the screen and definitely don't leave any kid of icon letting me know that I have notifications waiting for me.\n\nIt's like they expect you to just check your phone every 5 minutes? I won't do that, frankly and the kind of work I do, I can't be checking my phone all the time and need to know if there's anything important waiting for me to check my phone. And, to be frank, I'm a bit neurotic and would just greatly prefer to have some kind of indication rather than start checking my phone every few min.  \n  \nSo are there any settings that would fix this problem? with my s10, even if my screen was dark, an email/text/etc coming in would light the screen up to let me know I have a notification. And if I missed that there would be an icon displayed (even if the screen was off) to let me know there are unseen notifications on my phone.\n\nCould someone kindly walk me though on how to fix this?

I don’t want to lose any data, especially photos and personal information, so I’m hoping there’s a way to fix the issue without wiping the phone. If anyone has any suggestions or has dealt with this before, I would really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance!",

My microphone works independently, and the keyboard button activates the microphone, but it does not actually transcribe what I say. It just does nothing then shuts off. This started after I updated my phone yesterday and it's extremely frustrating. Last Gboard update was 4 days ago.",

    "text": "So, I tried connecting my girlfriend’s iPhone (14 pro max) to my Pixel 9 using a USB-C to Lightning cable, thinking it would be a quick and easy way to transfer some photos. Oh boy, what a disappointment.\n\nFirst off, the Pixel 9 just wouldn't stop trying to charge the iPhone. No matter what I did, it kept prioritizing charging, which is absolutely ridiculous for a modern phone. But the real pain started when I actually tried to move the photos.\n\nEvery time I selected around 50 pictures, the transfer would start but then just freeze after about 10 images. It was like the Pixel just gave up halfway through. I had to keep retrying, and even then, it was inconsistent at best.\n\nI honestly expected better from Google. How is it that in 2025, their flagship phone can't handle something as basic as file transfer properly? It’s incredibly frustrating. Has anyone else tried this and faced the same issues? Any workarounds?",

Now I have contacted Google by phone and email multiple times, they have given me the same jargon, even referenced my case to the google pixel specialists and have responded twice that they will respond to my case within 72 hours and both times they have not and I am getting really fed up because this has been going on for three months now.\n\n  \nEssentially when I go to pay contactless in a store (this has happened in every store) or use google pay to by something online or put money into a revolut account for example, verification pops up as normal (this happens whether I am verifying with a pin or biometrics, etc.). I put my code in/scan my fingerprint and then another verification screen pops up, I verify once again and it returns me to my google wallet app or the website I am trying to pay on. \n\n  \nWhat I have noticed is this. The second verification screen tries to open the google pay app, however the google pay is not downloaded nor downloadable on my phone. When I press the google pay app logo on the window of the second verification screen and press app info it opens google play services on the settings app. As mentioned Google has been absolutely no help to me whatsoever, the only solution I have seen online thus far is the clear the google play services data, however I am not sure how that is going to effect my phone. \n\n  \nHoping someone can help.

I wanted that function since I used it in the \"old days\" of CyanogenMod on my Galaxy S2.\n\nBeing able to choose specifically depending of the context different levels of DND and setup if for different apps by modes is pretty powerful and the implementation of it seems really well done in terms of versatility for me.\n\nAm I alone to like it? If not, I'm curious about what you are using modes to.",

This is how it looks like after only a few minutes of cycling, with the phone in my pocket: https://imgur.com/a/bfkqr4Z. The case is a Quadlock MAG case, so with a magnet in it. I did a test without the case, tapping with a tiny stroke on the screen. I used both a fleece and a cotton cloth. That resulted into this: https://imgur.com/a/kCgllyV. The same thing does not happen with my Galaxy. Must be some coating from the screen? Hopefully this does not last forever. Any experiences? I don't want to cover it with a screen protector.",

(also one that shows up in search)  This issue occurs for me when I restart or update in the dark.\n\nSolution:  If this issue happens to you, take your phone to a brightly lit room or into the sun.  Power on your screen and unlock your phone.  Tap the phone a few times just to the left of the front facing camera.  Raise your finger at least 6 inches with each tap and hold each tap for a half second.  This is recalibrating the proximity sensor.\n\nYou should now be able to make phone calls normally and double tap to wake your phone.",

    "text": "I asked a few months ago about your thoughts on the Google pixel 7 pro and it helped me to decide to get one! I absolutely love this phone and I can't justify going back to iPhone. I bought this pixel 7 pro with a case and screen protector but the screen protector gets scratched and cracked so quickly it makes this rlly nice looking phone into a beat up regular android. I'm just asking if anyone else has had these problems and what screen protector and case they found to fix it? Thx",

Literally every piece of tech that supports sharing, supports it from pretty much anything BUT a Google device. \n\nThe navigation buttons are annoying. The home button will routinely do nothing at all. The back and app buttons are reversed as well, leading to muscle memory mis-taps. But the home button doing nothing is by far the most annoying. \n\nThere's no ear-level speaker for calls? The speaker is literally on the top of the device, not where you'd hold the phone to listen to a call. So, for me at least, the call is audible to anyone nearby and the caller sounds like they're talking from another room. \n\nApp functionality issues - apps that work fine on other devices consistently lockup and/or crash on the Pixel. \n\nNo dual-bluetooth ability. On my S21 I could pair earbuds + another device, or car + another device, simultaneously. Not now - one device at a time. \n\nAll in all, to be a 4-generations newer device I feel like I actually downgraded by \"upgrading\".",

    "text": "I recently did my first screen (and battery) replacement. It was for my Pixel 7 Pro. Everything is working fine except some issues with my lock screen. I'd appreciate some help tracking down the issue.\n\nWhat's happening: When I lock my phone (using the side button) the display goes dim and shows the time (lock screen). But then after about 30sec the screen goes black. Touching the screen or moving the phone doesn't change anything, instead I have to click the side button to activate the screen, and then I can unlock (using fingerprint, face, etc).\n\nThis behavior is not what it was before I replaced my screen. I have Lock Screen set to \"Always show time and info\" = on, \"Tap to check phone\" = on, and \"Lift to check phone\" = on. With these settings, I'd expect that lifting or tapping my phone should wake it up. I'd also expect to never have a blank screen.\n\nI downloaded a sensor-checking program and all of my sensors work except the proximity sensor -- it reads 0.0cm at all times. I can't find any info about how this is related to my issues, but it seems it is possibly the culprit since it lives behind the screen. Unfortunately, I did not run these sensor tests before the screen replacement.\n\n  \nAny ideas or suggestions?",

    "text": "u/PixelCommunity (TL;DR is the first 4 paragraphs). Most of this is probably a rant, but I just want visibility at this point. I want it known that Google is aware of the problem, but is doing nothing about it.\n\nI'm so ticked off right now. Google refuses to recognize that the Pixel 8 line has issues with Wifi. This isn't an issue that is unique to me. A quick Reddit (or unironically, Google) search will show that this is a widespread issue.\n\nWifi will randomly just turn off. And it will not turn back on. I've rebooted (at this point, hundreds of times). Sometimes a reboot works, most times it does not. I have tried Safe Mode. I've shut off Adaptive Connectivity. I've reset Mobile & Network settings. I reluctantly factory reset my phone this morning (oooooh and I am SO angry now). The issue is not resolved.\n\nI've connected to ADB via USB. I can't recall the exact error, but something about \"Wifi failed connecting 10 times. Turning off\". Whatever hardware/software issue this is, Google refuses to acknowledge the problem.\n\nI just got off with chat support. My warranty expired in December, so they're telling me I'm SOL. The cost to fix the phone is all on me.\n\nSo, I'm considering taking my Pixel 8 Pro and taping it to a 1/4 stick of dynamite. And it will be the last Google device I ever own. Yeah, I get it, they've already got my money for the phone. And yeah, I'm one measly little guy over here, so how is any of that going to impact such a giant like Google? It's not.\n\nI have been a loyal Google nutswinger since the Pixel 1. I upgraded to the Pixel 3XL. Then the Pixel 5. And finally the Pixel 8 Pro. I've loved Google so much that I got my wife to switch from Samsung to Google. She's had the Pixel 3XL, Pixel 6, and now she's on the Pixel 8.\n\nWith my Pixel 3XL, I decided I'd buy Preferred Care as a safety net. What an absolute NIGHTMARE. I dropped my phone and destroyed my screen. I take full responsibility for damaging my phone.\n\nAt the time, I lived 2.5 hours away from the nearest UBREAKIFIX store. One way. In the meantime, I got creative and used a computer mouse with my phone (thank you Linux!!!).\n\nEventually, I took a day trip! I dropped my phone off and a few hours later, went back to retrieve it. Only to find out, they couldn't fix the problem. And they only had 1 screen in stock (the one they used in the attempted repair). So, I left with my broken phone.\n\nA few weeks later, I returned to that same store after confirming they had another screen in stock. Hours later, went to retrieve my phone, basically the same story. One screen in stock and it didn't work.\n\nA few weeks later on, I went to another store. There was a 2+ week wait to get my phone repaired, and I'd have to leave it there and be without a phone for who knows how long. Of course, I did not leave my phone there.\n\nAnother few weeks and I went to ANOTHER store. They gave me some BS line saying that they needed the screen to work in order to test that the other phone functionality works. I told them they could get into whatever they needed by using the mouse. They told me that wasn't allowed, they had to be able to PHYSICALLY use the screen. Uhm, Preferred Care, which is supposed to cover accidental damage, including a broken screen, failed me miserably.\n\nNaturally, I refused to buy Preferred Care on any future phone. Why buy something that is a total scam? I had 20 TRAVEL hours invested. That doesn't include the few hours I waited for the first 2 attempts.\n\nAnd ya know what I did, even though I was soured by the entire experience? I BOUGHT ANOTHER GOOGLE PIXEL! How f%&$ing stupid of me...",

She and my dad moved overseas less than a year ago and got a local number, but, as you can imagine, changing recovery numbers wasn't a priority for her.\n* **The Password Paradox:** She actually remembers her Google password, but it seems she got locked out after multiple attempts (or some other Google security measure). Now, it's forcing verification via that US Google Voice number, which is inaccessible because the phone is dead.\n* **The Chromebook Betrayal:** She has a Chromebook, which I thought would be a saving grace. Nope. It mysteriously signed her out, and it's also requiring verification via the same inaccessible number.\n* **The Fallout:** All her important accounts—health portals (MyChart), Facebook, everything—are tied to that Google account. She's essentially lost access to her medical records and social connections.\n\nI'm beyond frustrated. This is a complete disaster. We've opened a new email, but it's a band-aid on a gaping wound.\n\nSeriously, how is this not happening to more people, especially older folks? Phones can just die, and if you don't have robust recovery options, you're screwed.\n\n**My Plea to You:**\n\n* Go. Now. Check your recovery email and phone number. Make sure they're up-to-date and accessible.\n* Set up multiple recovery options.\n* Consider a legacy contact.\n* Get those authenticator app offline codes and store them somewhere safe.\n* Back up everything, and test your backups.\n* Educate your older family members.\n\nIt's insane how much we rely on these devices and accounts, and how easily it can all be taken away.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: Mom's Pixel 6 died, she's locked out of her Google account, and therefore, her entire digital life, because of outdated recovery info. Check your recovery options NOW.",

Every other OEM that I know of has double tap to wake to make it more consistent. Not to mention the most important component missing: ↓\n\n• Tap to sleep/ lock! \nI have to wait for it to turn off before putting it back in my pocket. Inconvenient and annoying. Oh, just press the lock button? Then why even use tap to wake..\n\nSo when these things come up, I ask my iPhone buddy, and once again he confirms that's how it is on iOS. Interesting!\n\n• Switching between REAR and FRONT cameras WHILE recording videos. \nAbsolutely essentially while traveling and doing vlog style videos to capture memories. I used it very often for as long as I can remember. \n\nSame story. iPhone buddy confirms it's the same for him. Yet obviously absent on any other major Android OEM. Odd!\n\n• Dimming the torch/ flashlight. \nI use this almost every night. The flashlight is way too bright at default. No ability to tone it down. \n\nGuess who else has this issue on a different device? Not my friends who have different Android phones. \n\nDo I really need to get into everything else like haptic feedback and all the little things? You get the point. \n\nNow I'm seeing iOS have more features than my Android phone. Unbelievable. I mean even the iPhone can adjust the brightness with a single swipe down.

One I use currently (the Motorola) and an S22+ that sits in my closet because the charge it holds doesn't compare to the Edge. \n\nCurrently I have in my cart on the Samsung website a trade in for the S22+, in exchange for a S25 Ultra. \n\nI own a small business and I feel like it would be a significant upgrade for me to go in this direction. Any feedback would be great!\n\nThanks!",

I have fiddled around with the display settings - most of them dont do anything much, especially the supposed 'vivid slider' that everyone was talking about, it does absolutely nothing.\n\nI have seen numerous posts on the matter. Is there a proper solution? Or is my display defective? I do also get that rainbow effect when tilting it, but apparently thats normal.",

    "text": "To my fellow Samsung users, we've all experienced the frustration of our phones' battery life degrading over time. While Samsung has introduced features to mitigate this, I believe a more intuitive solution exists: \"Battery Protection Mode.\"\n\nInstead of simply limiting charging to 85%, this software feature would redefine how the battery percentage is displayed.\n\n**Proposed Functionality:**\n\n* Upon activation, the phone would restart and recalibrate the battery indicator.\n* The displayed \"0%\" would correspond to the battery's actual 20% charge, and \"100%\" would represent the actual 85% charge.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n* Reduces the stress of needing to recharge the device the moment it hits 20% on the battery indicator.\n* Maintains the familiar experience of seeing a \"full\" 100% battery icon after charging\n\n  \nThis proposal presents no discernible drawbacks, and I see no reason why it cannot be implemented. Users who wish to utilize the full capacity of their battery can easily disable this feature and revert to the standard battery protection settings.\n\nAnd users like myself, can enabled this feature and have a fully displayed battery icon when taken off charge, and have no worry of the battery draining to 0%.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n  \nRegards",

Is this faulty proximity session or the wrong placement of the phone near my ear? Is there a way to remove Hold option from the call screen whatsoever?\n\nThanks.",

Smooth operation even with many apps running (Samsung came to their senses and made every version 12 GB of RAM)\n5. Competitors from China undoubtedly have better battery life, but even during the \"usage patter learning period\" the SOT is great - above 6 hours of mixed usage. \nCons:\n1. Camera is not the best in it's league, tho the software experience concerning the camera is one of the best. (It's not a bad camera, just that the Chinese phones and maybe even pixels have a better one).\n\nOverall it's a great phone, but considering everything I kinda regret not waiting a bit for a Xiaomi 15, even though it has it's cons...\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "title": "Is it worth investing in Samsung devices for a long term",
    "text": "I know this is a debate that’s been around for decades, but with Samsung continuously raising its prices, it feels like they’re trying to follow Apple’s strategy—just without the foundation of their own operating system.\n\nSamsung has put a lot of effort into OneUI across phones, tablets, watches, and even laptops. But at the end of the day, it’s still just a \"skin,\" not a standalone OS. I’m generally satisfied with their phones, tablets, and earbuds, but their laptops have been disappointing.\n\nI’ve been using the Galaxy Book Flex (2020), and since it runs Windows, it suffers from the usual Windows issues, becoming sluggish after just three years. Now, even when idle, the fan spins like crazy the moment I turn it on.\n\nMy point is, while Samsung excels in the portable device market, I’m not as confident in their laptops because they’re entirely reliant on Windows. Meanwhile, Apple runs its own OS across all its devices, giving it full control over optimization. I'm not sure if that directly makes their devices more stable, but it certainly gives them an advantage in ensuring smoother long-term performance.\n\nFor me, comparing the latest generation of both company, Galaxy wins in the category of phone, tablet, buds, while Apple wins in laptop, and watches. (My GW5P is kinda lagging after 2.5y of use)\n\nWhat's more important, there have been continuous reports of cracking screens on the galaxy books, which really make me hesitate of whether I should invest over 2500 in the galaxy book 4 ultra, or the newer model later this year.\n\nI don't quite understand why Samsung never come up with their own OS, besides the Tizen. And the biggest question is, is it worth investing in Samsung devices for a long term i.e. getting deep into the Samsung ecosystem?",

However the main selling point for me is the quality of picture for gaming.\nWhat would be your suggestions? Any similar priced TVs you would recommend? P.s.

But on S25 i mistype EVERY SINGLE sentence.  EVERY SINGLE sentence got something mistyped in there.\n\nI wouldn't even totally lost it if it was every other sentence, but no no no, it was EVERY SENTENCE.  Every 10 words got 5 of them wrong.\n\nI'm not talking about English typing, i'm talking about chinese pinyin. And on iPhone if you mistyped, you can only change the part you mistyped, but on samsung you'll have to delete the whole sentence....... WTF!\n\nI just don't get it how is something so simple can be so wrong on samsung.....\n\nI shattered the phone and i am not gonna fix it, i'm gonna get back to iPhone.\n\nEdit 1: Yes, I admit I should have composed myself, but I was in the hospital and I was trying to juggle 2 heated tasks at the same time.

    "text": "So I bought the S23 Ultra around a year ago, just as the S24 was coming out. I love this phone so far, but I can't get over the frequency of the software updates. Normally, I don't even think about it and just schedule them to happen overnight when I'm sleeping. \n\nBut today is kinda crazy. I've been ignoring the software update for a few days (as usual lol) and then yesterday scheduled it to be done overnight at 3AM. It's now not even 10AM here yet, and the phone popped up a new software update. I'm confused. Were there bugs in the last one and this is a patch to fix? I'm not criticising, honestly, just wondering why there are so many frequent updates?",

I'm on a Samsung s23U which has dolby atmos, the problem is that with my headphones, when I watch a series, I find the sounds much deeper and more spatialized when I deactivate Atmos, for example in the severance series on Canal+ (which has the atmos label for compatibility), there is a passage with some sort of high-pitched audio glitch which sizzles, they are completely inaudible with Atmos, the same for the effects of big saturated hums which add an immersion effect. So here's my question, what could this be due to? Why does the sound seem more immersive and the soundstage wider without Atmos?",

I saw on other threads dating way back mentioning that Samsung wanted to push their proprietary audio drivers to the Galaxy Buds. I researched around and found [this](https://avantree.com/products/c82-usb-c-ps5-bluetooth-adapter) and was wondering if anyone was able to utilize a similar product that allowed the S25Ultra to actually utilize the AptX drivers?  \nThanks everyone!",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs an avid Samsung fan, I've always been quick to snag their latest products. So, when the S25+ was up for pre-order with a bonus of 50,000 reward points if purchased within 24 hours, I jumped at the chance, purchasing through the education store.\n\nTo ensure everything was set, I asked Samsung’s WhatsApp support if my order would qualify for the reward points. They assured me it would. However, the points never showed up. Upon following up, I was told my purchase wasn’t eligible based on terms and conditions that were unclear at the time of purchase.\n\nWhile I hadn’t mentioned to support, I had considered canceling and reordering through the official store for better benefits. But, trusting their assurance, I didn’t proceed with the cancellation.\n\nSamsung's proposed resolution was to take action against the agent who provided the incorrect information, which doesn’t help me at all. I find it unreasonable to expect customers to navigate every intricacy of their T&Cs, especially when I proactively sought clarification.\n\nDespite my loyalty and repeated attempts to rectify the situation, Samsung is adamant that there’s no compensation available. This experience has been incredibly disappointing, and unfortunately, I’ve decided this S25+ will be my last Samsung purchase.\n\nI’ve added a screenshot of my conversation with customer support in this post as well as the promotion in question. Has anyone else faced a similar situation?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvbk593hb6oe1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f635fad01dc19507cd04e79b28803802e6bfa358\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8sk6ud3hb6oe1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=126d4d85240024d49fefff4392e2dd11c6524aa1",

So I want to know if I should get the S25 this year or wait and see what the S26 looks like or the next google Pixel. \n\nThe other phone I was looking at was the Google pixel 9 pro but I'll most likely wait until the pixel 10 before going google. \n\nUpdate: I will look into getting the S25 ultra this up coming Sunday at the atnt store.

In January, got a bright line down the middle of the inside screen exactly where the crease was. I had a ding on a corner so Samsung wouldnt replace under warranty and had to pay the deductible, not happy but whatever.\n\nGet the replacement device within 24 hours and within a couple of days, the replacement device had the exact same line right where the crease was. Contact Samsung and they send me a third device. Get everything transferred and leave the country on vacation\n\nOut and about and the outside of the device gets SPLASHED with water, sucks it in somehow and now the camera doesn't work, it won't switch to the inner screen and I turn it off so it doesn't get damaged further. Go to a Samsung center in the other country and get told \"sorry, the care package only applies if you're in the US, it doesn't count here\" again, not happy but whatever. Buy a cheap Samsung phone to get me through the trip.\n\nReturn home, try and submit a claim to get my phone replaced and told \"sorry, they haven't closed your iriginal claim (I was on vacation for 2 weeks!), somethings stuck on the backend, and we can only have one claim open at a time, so you have to wait 24 hrs for it to close and open a new claim.\" That was Saturday, called in Monday and told \"sorry, backend team doesn't work weekends, that other person shouldn't have told you 24 hours, it'll be 24 hours from now\" 🤬\n\nSo here I sit, with my third fold 6, only partially working, waiting 24 hours so hopefully I can open a claim and have my 4th fold sent to me 24 hours after that, and probably going to have to fight with them on the deductible.\n\nIf you were like me and are worried about the durability of the fold:\n\nYou're right to worry, others here have commented on their inside screens getting damaged right where the crease is\n\nIf you're counting on Care + to save you, beware they send you refurbished units with no water or dust proof rating. You never know the quality of the refurb phone you're going to get and can quickly have additional problems\n\nI'd be really leery having it as your only phone during travel away from your home country, had so many problems with 2fa on sites while my phone was down.",

I checked a few settings per a few YouTube videos -clean\\empty cache from Smart Switch, etc., I also dropped top screen resolution. When I want it, I'll turn it up to max). Anyway, around the start of the 2nd week, I started noticing that it was working markedly better. A very noticeable improvement as it learned 'me'. I don't measure numbers or anything, don't play games, and mostly use it with Wi-Fi in the house. But my battery life is substantial now. It's fantastic. \n\nAfter the two rather large updates, it improved even further. Everything about the general function of the phone has been excellent. Hard to point to any one thing, it's just so 'pleasant' to use and handle. I've had most, if not all, the ultras, I even had a Note 3. It feels sick and polished and I'm totally happy with the cameras. I'm also using a Flip 6 for my other line. Very happy with it too, but my 25+ is my primary. \n\nThat's all!",

    "text": "I’ve been using iphones for the past 10 years now (Started with 5s then went to 6s, 11 pro max, finally currently with 15 pro max) and I’m thinking of making the switch to a base S25. I had an opportunity to use a second hand S23 for a short time last year and the experience was amazing. Navigation is soooo easy thanks to one hand operation+, seeing the charge time on the device, being able to copy multiple texts in clipboard, etc. It was refreshing to be able to do lots of things\n\nNow, I’m thinking of trading my 15 pro max for the base S25. I liked the compact size of the S23 thats why Im leaning on this device. My concern with android in general is longevity and build quality. Samsung has been known to be plagued with the infamous green lines and that it slows down after a year or two. There’s also app quality in which they feel much optimized in ios\n\nJust want to hear your opinion on these. Please do share your experience switching and what made you stay. Cheers!",

I think when I first got it in August, the battery was great - I could last maybe 20 hours without charging. Now, after 7 months, the battery life has decreased dramatically. 4 hours of use depletes my battery by maybe 60% percent. I checked my settings, and it said showed that 70% equaled two and a half hours remaining. Has anyone else been experiencing something like this? It is quite annoying.",

    "title": "Had to get a battery replaced. Now I'm noticing oddities. [S22]",
    "text": "Last night, I noticed that my phone's case was deformed in an unusual manner. Popping the case off confirmed that the battery had begun to expand and push out the back of the phone.\n\nLooked around for a phone repair place open on Sundays (Not many options available, because small town) and eventually found one operating out of a Walmart.\n\n$120 to replace the battery, which I shrugged at and agreed to.\n\nPrior to handing my phone over, I had enabled Maintenance mode, and shut the phone itself down. The repair took just under 30 minutes, and I did not watch the process (we went shopping for other things in the meanwhile).\n\nUpon getting the phone back, I noticed a Data Usage warning. Not a particular problem, as I do have unlimited data usage, but still odd, given that the month had just started, and I don't use my phone that much. Checking the data usage, 1.8GB of data was utilized by 'Removed apps and users'. This, obviously, was not my doing. Prior to that, my most used app for the month was Firefox at 130mb.\n\nI am not particularly concerned about any data on my device having been compromised. I do not have a microSD card on the phone, and the phone is secured by both a PIN and a fingerprint. Additionally, as mentioned above, I did have maintenance mode enabled, so data theft should not have been possible. But I am curious as to what this data usage spike could have been.\n\nIn addition to this, my fingerprint sensor is no longer functional. It would rarely recognize my fingerprint, so I made an attempt at deleting the two fingerprints I had and re-doing them. This has proved unsuccessful, as I cannot even get the fingerprint sensor to cooperate long enough to get one fingerprint back. 90% of the time, attempting to add a fingerprint back onto the system simply results in a \"Make sure the fingerprint sensor is dry and clean, then try again.\" error. The few times that I am able to get past this error, I can scan a fingerprint to about 47%, and then I get a 'please ensure your finger is placed entirely within the circle' (or something to that effect), regardless of how many re-attempts I give it.\n\nThe rest of the phone appears to work just fine, however. I Have a case, but no screen protector. The touchscreen works just fine with no errors, including in the area that the fingerprint sensor uses. I would presume that the technician simply neglected to connect a cable correctly or something, but if that were the case, I would presume the entire touchscreen would be suffering issues, which it isn't.\n\nAppreciate any insight into either of these issues.\n\n\n\nEdit: Resolved the fingerprint issue with simple determination. Just kept trying it, and finally got it to register my fingerprints again. Now seems completely functional once the fingerprints were registered. Now only the data mystery remains.",

    "title": "The s24 is the worst second to only the Note 7",
    "text": "I have a pair of Galaxy buds 2 pro, Galaxy s24 standard and I've had a bunch of Samsung devices over the years. It was my handset of choice ever since I laid my hands on the Galaxy S9 Plus. When the Galaxy S9 Plus was new, I remember having that phone. It was the best thing since baked bread! Solid performance, beautiful waterfall style display and just all around a great experience. \n\nThen I got the Galaxy a21 as a side phone, that one was awesome too! \n\nLater down the line, I had a Galaxy a13 4G because my S9 and S9 Plus finally kicked the bucket (due to a bad parts vendor, don't buy from group vertical ever) \n\nThe a13 4G wasn't very fast, but would it lacked in speed it well made up for in camera technology. The sensors weren't amazing, but there were plenty of them for all sorts of situations. \n\nEven though there were a bunch of sensors, I want you to know that the color and contrast were balanced in between all of them perfectly. \n\nMy parents would later get s21s and they were really good. They're still really good to this day, arguably better than my current phone. \n\nA little more phone hunting went on as I used the Galaxy a14 5G (Nice handset as well Even though I waited a little while for one UI 6), and then a Galaxy a25 5G. After all of this, I got the Galaxy s24 and the Galaxy buds 2 pro to treat myself to something nice. What did I get from that? Absolutely nothing. \n\nThe display is disgusting and grainy, the aluminum frame is soft and delicate and the color options are extremely underwhelming. \n\nThe phone constantly overheats thanks to the cortex x style processor and is stuttering constantly even when it has no reason because of bad software optimization. Instagram reels slows to a crawl because they don't dump the cache correctly.\n\nThe cameras all have a different color temperature and sharpness and lighting requirements so switching in between lenses is garbage on video, it's more jarring than any Samsung Galaxy I've ever seen in my entire life. It's truly hateful. \n\nWhat do I get for getting the latest and greatest earbuds with the phone? Less than halfway through the phone's life cycle they release the Galaxy buds 3. I'm really upset about that one. \n\nAnd what screwed the Golden goose for me is the ONEUI7 problems. Usually in December we get the updates, they're talking about releasing it in freaking April. What are they smoking? \n\nAnd now they're talking about rushing one UI 8 which is going to be underwhelming of course and have tons of problems as well. I'm beginning to ask myself are the seven years of software updates I was promised even worth it? Imagine year seven comes by and they have a slight delay on releasing that software so they just don't give me it. That sounds entirely like the new Samsung. \n\nThe Samsung that made the Galaxy S8 and S9 is dead. My next phone will not be a Samsung Galaxy. I bought it out of brand respect and trust and I got my butt handed to me. We don't even need to talk about how out of place the s24 ultra looks, my dad has that thing and it's very very very ugly. It's hideous. Especially when you line it up with the curved angular phones of the s24 generation. Sure maybe they fixed that with the s25, but they also spawned another thousand problems with that phone. I'm just done. \n\nBrand loyalty doesn't mean anything anymore. I'm going to get a Google Pixel or something. Maybe if this thing is still in warranty, I'll return it for Google Pixel. Absolutely hateful device.",

    "text": "I've got a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. \n\nRight above the fingerprint sensor, and right below the fingerprint sensor, there's a line from side to side, very hard to see, almost looks like a screen scratch. But it's probably just an outline from the fingerprint sensor. It's very hard to see. And I'd have to take my screen protector off to even see it. \n\nBut if your screen protector is off, do you see this on your Galaxy S25 Ultra? You have to look very carefully under direct sunlight",

    "text": "I have an Odyssey Neo G7 and I have noticed that games I play are commonly blotchy in the shadows, and it clicks between brightness levels abruptly enough that it looks like the shadows are actively moving. I thought this was just a limitation of the tech until I realized it only happens on the Auto setting. When Off, Low, or High the shadows appear natural. It looks like it must be some kind of quirky algorithm just in use for the Auto setting.\n\n\"If you select Auto, Local Dimming will be automatically turned on or off based on whether the content if HDR\"\n\nIs there a way to make this statement in the interface TRUE? Normal PC use (Not HDR) looks awful on Low or High, but Auto is clearly doing more than just toggling Local Dimming On/Off. I only bought this monitor with the assumption said manual would be honest, and the buttons on the bottom are not designed well enough for me to be regularly using them to change settings.",

    "text": "So if you'll indulge me on this rant...\n\nSouth African here. Got a contract upgrade to the S25 last Sunday. As I'm sure you can imagine, I was quite excited about the upgrade since my last phone was (and still is...) the S21. I took my phone home and began doing all the usual set up that I always do. A clean setup, no smart switch for me. I prefer doing it this way so I can see what apps are being used and what features the device can offer.\n\nI was almost done with the setup when the screen went black. Completely died on me. I immediately turned to Google and Reddit for solutions and did the soft resert thay was suggested everywhere, but to no avail.\n\nOn Monday, 9am, I walked I to Vodacom, the store where I have my contract and was their first customer. The lady who sorted my contract was displeased with the issue and booked my phone in for repairs. She ensured me that it's a factory fault, and I will have a new device by Wednesday.\n\nTurns out, Vodacom had different ideas. The phone went from their repair center to advanced repairs, where it still hasn't been assigned a technician. This means I haven't been able to change devices because they are not currently looking at the device.\n\nAfter some Google work, I found out that some people have been complaining online about the same problem. Chances are they won't give me a new device and will charge me for repairs.\n\nMy question is quite simple: Should I rather get the S24 ultra if I'm expected to pay? Or what alternate device do you guys suggest?",

    "text": "I'm sure many of you are aware of the fact that the latest Galaxy A series devices have gotten rid of the microSD card and I want to share my thoughts with the community, and get some feedback regarding this matter.\n\nFirstly, Samsung's whole business model is based on selling hardware. Sure, removing the microSD card slot makes sense for Apple and Google who make money off of cloud services like iCloud and Google Drive but how does that benefit Samsung when they're one of the highest rated microSD card manufacturers? Who are they going to sell their products to? Furthermore, the only storage option for the A36 and A56 is 256GB so it doesn't even make sense from the perspective of selling upgraded models for inflated prices. Sure, removing the headphone jack made sense from Samsung's perspective since they're now making more money off of selling the Galaxy Buds but removing the expandable storage just makes no sense from their standpoint.\n\nSecondly, expandability, customizability, flexibility and user choice is the core value of Android and is the main aspect in which Android devices differentiate from iOS and Apple. Without them, Android devices would be inherently inferior to iPhones as they both lack the features that tech enthusiasts appreciate and also lack the perfected software experience which Apple devices offer (and let's be objective, Android will never be able to be on par with Apple when it comes to the software experience)\n\nI really don't understand why they would remove functionality in vain. To appeal more to Apple users? But Apple users are already quite content with Apple's offerings, they're just hurting their own loyal customers for no reason.\n\nPersonally, I use both the microSD card and wired headphones on a daily basis. I keep all of my files backed up on my SD card, I use the extra storage to download videos/photos which I enjoy since you never know when your favorite social media platform either bans you, gets banned, or when the content gets removed from their services either from the uploader or the platform itself. I have YEARS of content on my SD card which has outlived several phones, and sure, I could live with an adapter for my headphones (which already pisses me off since the adapters break every other week) but the removal of the microSD card slot is such a dealbreaer that I'd rather switch to a different brand or completely stop using smartphones in case the competition also stops selling smartphones with expandable storage.\n\nI want to know what the community thinks about this matter since I really can't see a positive outcome from this action.",

    "title": "S25 Ultra Feedback",
    "text": "Let's be honest, Samsung should be ashamed of themselves. I've been a Galaxy user since the S1 and I upgraded nearly ever year up until the Note10 Plus. The S25 Ultra has a great camera, exceptional resolution, better response time, and feels durable, but that's where the compliments stop. I promise you Samsung, this AI push is not what your customers care the most about and we're very upset with Galaxy phones slowly becoming a replica of the iPhone. The UI is horrendous! It's 2025 and there's no reason we should be restricted to this new layout they forced on us. I'm missing notifications, have to go through multiple steps to see if a Bluetooth device is connected and view my media player. The upgraded battery (that they promise every release) is a lie. My AOD is 4% of my battery usage and my used Note 20 Ultra's battery lasts longer than my new S25 Ultra. These are just a few highlights of the issues I'm facing. Here are some others: \n\n•Notification panel is grouped, not stacked. You can only see the most recent notification in that category which makes it very easy to miss important notifications. \n\n•Have to press hard for fingerprint to read. Was ok at first, even after the screen protector was put on. Then just randomly became difficult.\n\n•Fingerprint scanner constantly rejects my fingerprints. Clean and dry, or moist (it actually recommended to moisten my fingers one time). I have each finger registered twice and I'm still having random issues. They're not consistent.\n\n•S Pen button not working. Nothing happens when you press the button. *Yes, the option is enabled in the settings. \n\n•Some app login screens will not automatically show biometrics. *Same apps work well on my Note20 Ultra. \n\n•All copied text doesn't go to clipboard. \n\n•Google Screen Context \"Show What's On My Screen\" randomly stops working. *Digital assistant is switched to Google Assistant and Screen Context is on. \n\n•Bluetooth connection doesn't show in the status bar. Have to go directly to quick panel. *Even GoodLock doesn't override this. \n\n•Can't take pictures while recording video. \n\n•Samsung Pass quick button on keyboard keeps disappearing. \n\n•Some notifications don't show. Specifically emails from Outlook. *Yes, notifications are enabled. \n\n•Same notifications (Google and Satellite Phone) pop back up after each restart. These notifications have been there since the first day I used the phone. You can't turn the Satellite Phone notification off and I'll miss Google notifications if I turn that one off.\n\n•Notifications stay in panel, even after you open them. Especially Google Maps. I think this issue is related to the one mentioned above. \n\n•If you start a message in \"Messages\", the contact will stay at the top, even if you typed them by mistake. No draft or anything, just a blank message. \n\n•When you reply to messages through the notification bar, messages are still marked as unread. (This issue has been happening since the Note 10) \n\n•Media Picker doesn't show all albums.\n\n•Sometimes won't show my most recent pictures when gallery shows up. \n\n•In the \"Recent\" tab I'm not only seeing pictures from days ago, but also pictures from my other phone. *The phone is connected by Quick Share, but why would it only show a couple of pictures?\n\n•Small media player on lock screen. When you double-tap, it gets bigger but eventually goes back small. Where's the option to keep your screen as a media player? \n\n•When you select something, then go back to the previous menu, it starts you back at the top. \n\n•Screen issues. One minute it will copy text, the next it won't. \n\n•What is the solution for the Samsung Keyboard? Swype-to-text hardly works accurately. If you capitalize a word once, it continues to capitalize every time after unless you completely delete the word and manually type it lowercase. \n\n•You can't view images that were sent in \"Messages\" unless it's been delivered and there's no way to stop the send, even if it's still pending. *It's 2025, there's no reason this is still happening. \n\n•No notifications for contacts' birthday. *This issue isn't exclusive to the S25 Ultra. This has been going on for years. And yes, the notifications for birthdays are enabled \n\n•Can't see the entire picture when sending images in Messages.  \n\n•The screen doesn't scroll sometimes when selecting text. \n\n•Can't move all icons in the quick panel. \n\n•Alarmy alarm app not showing over lock screen. *Yes, drawing over apps and other permissions are enabled and I've been using this since around the S4.\n\n•dezl app not automatically connecting \n\n•Love's shower notification. Does not alert me if the app isn't open. This is time-sensitive so it's very annoying that isn't working correctly. *The app is \"unrestricted\" and the power saver is off. \n\n•Can't filter nor search contacts by groups. *So what's the point of still having groups\n\n•Still seeing duplicates of some contacts when I dial their number, yet it says no other accounts have their information. (Not an S25 issue, but a Samsung one) \n\n•SEEMS like bluetooth and wifi automatically turn, but it could be when I'm connecting a device with AA or Quick Share turning BT on",
