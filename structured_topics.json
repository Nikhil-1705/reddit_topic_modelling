One u.i used hate One u.i back days , point main reason keeping away Samsung . days Samsung known useless bloatware gone . Yes still quite . uninstalled , like samsung internet really bring plus table a.i integration . total absolute personalisation , font style folder size everything imaginable , without needing launcher . even get personalisation options one u.i Nova launcher , particularly confident enough dive developer mode . work ability fully arrange homescreens everything eyes completely tailored mind structure great . 2 . A.i talking a.i present S25U , people often relate `` gimmicky '' . guess refer media oriented a.i , like picture modification a.i based drawings . things REALLY useful work environment . couple non exhaustive examples : - voice recorder great voice recognition transcription recorded audios . Super useful personal use also transcripts meetings . even translate . - goes document related a.i : resuming documents , rewording written documents better way , text number recognition pdfs , pictures etc ... handful features work environment function well 3 . pen used galaxy note hardly used pen , hassle go handwritten notes , particularly small screen tiny pen make crappy hand writing . A.i game changer use pen . hand written notes transcribed regular text , use search engine go using keywords , integrate many apps , etc ... using pen take quick notes meetings . Samsung note app amazingly easy friendly use . Overall feel like S25U rated office work phone , brings great useful features phone whatever hardware bring . One feel extensive experience Samsung earned designing U.I practical user friendly manner years . Everything makes sense . sure boring designs phones . Yes 's sad n't upgrade like least carbon silicon battery year . Yes camera great stills far great moving objects people . Yes , personal use definitely good better options . office work ? Sorry sorry , nothing comes close S25U . final love statement , adore design Galaxy watch 7 . beats old apple watch 10 times aesthetic wise . round case fits watch faces much better . proposed watch faces gorgeous . attention details small blue red accents strap candy eye , 's super comfortable wear . gon na attach picture side side wrist dull Apple watch comparison ca n't , sure .",

Let explain Xiaomi 's solution significantly advanced Sony QX series . Like name suggests QX series Sony series actual standalone cameras simply without viewfinder grip . sensor , E-mount , batteries , processor microSD storage , 's full camera 's . could mounted phone using clamp would simply stream preview phone 's screen using Sony 's app . 's . phone acted viewfinder control exposure settings . click shutter , makes QX camera take photo like Sony mirrorless camera transfer image using WiFi Direct phone . QX30/10/100/1 basically standalone cameras . makes Xiaomi special fact phone 's ISP directly interacts actual MFT sensor module 10Gbps connection , giving access advanced modern image processing techniques ! Think multi-exposure stacked HDR , possible night mode , enhanced portrait mode etc . 's possible take clean looking/detailed night shots using real camera unless hulking around big f1.4 lens , 's possible take portrait mode shots really shallow DOF good compression unless carrying large 85mm f1.8 lens - computational photography + large MFT sensor theoretically enable best fake portrait mode shots/HDR/night mode images ! 's exactly Xiaomi able eke 16 stops DR MFT sensor module . [ two even remotely . look similar . ] ( https : //preview.redd.it/5adyxdelxime1.jpg ? width=3464 & format=pjpg & auto=webp & s=fd7f0c5e40759d60e1004dc907b44001107d2436 ) truly first time seeing MFT sensor + modern image signal processing ! Compared Samsung Galaxy NX , 's closer . Galaxy NX1 full APSC mirrorless camera guts Galaxy S4 ( think ) , early 2010s , computational photography practically non-existent , ISPs n't fast enough process APSC sensor data simply n't want apply processing . Mirrorless cameras still 's infancy Canon/Nikon DSLRs ruled market . Samsung left market Sony stuck later successful fields . One small gripe regarding Xiaomi : could 've exposed MFT mount , could attach MFT lens different brands like Leica , Panasonic , Olympus , Sigma etc . May save space . Thanks reading !",

HDR+ Videos erscheinen womöglich zunächst drastisch überbelichtet . Bevor man nun alle Szenen korrigiert , gab mir der Copilot den hilfreichen Tipp im Farbmanagement ( Colourmanagement ) vom 2100er auf das Rec.709 Farbprofil umzustellen . Sofort war alles Ordnung . Ich habe noch nicht weiter die Details prüfen können , aber lt. Copiloten ist das dann wohl SDR Farbprofil . Aber sieht gut aus . man HDR Material korrekt interpretieren , geht man mit der rechten Maustaste auf den Clip im Projekt nach `` Interpret footage '' , und sicherstellen , dass der Farbraum richtig erkannt wurde , also diesem Fall Rec.2100 HLg . Weiterhin gibts noch ein Programm innerhalb Premiere welches Lumetri heißt . Dort kann man ebenfalls Farben naturgetreu vom HDR den SDR Farbraum mappen . Habe selbt noch nicht alles verifizieren können , aber immerhin ists schon brauchbar geworden . Vielleicht hilfts dem einen oder anderen weiter ...",
